### testing django project common classes

- tl;dr -- it just works

- my questions
  - Would classes in a non-application directory be recognized by the test-harness? (yes)
  - Would settings for those tests work smoothly? (yes)

- [project containing 'common_classes' dir](https://github.com/birkin/easyaccess_project)
