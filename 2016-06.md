### testing django project common classes

- tl;dr -- it just works

- my questions
  - Would classes in a non-application directory be recognized by the test-harness? (yes)
  - Would settings for those tests work smoothly? (yes)

- [project containing 'common_classes' dir](https://github.com/birkin/easyaccess_project)

#### lxml install

_Issue: Normal pip install of lxml on finicky.server.edu fails._

- lxml install, from regular user account fails...

        $ source ./the_env/bin/activate
        [the_env] $ pip install lxml==3.3.6

- lxml install, from regular root account fails...

        $ sudo bash
        # source ./the_env/bin/activate
        [the_env] # pip install lxml==3.3.6

- lxml install, from path-aware root account **works**...

        $ sudo bash -l
        # source ./the_env/bin/activate
        [the_env] # pip install lxml==3.3.6

_(thx to j.m.)_

### dct['key'] vs dct.get( 'key', 'default' )

- [example](https://github.com/birkin/easyaccess_project/blob/f48d21a6e7693c7eb810159a0f246163f64189a1/article_request_app/classes/illiad_helper.py#L80) where returned value isn't a simple default, but nice solution to need for conditional update.
