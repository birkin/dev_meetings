### old django db spec in json

- situation, old django project is using line-by-line database specifications instead of the new dictionary specification -- but you still want to switch to a single shell-settings file referenced by both `env/bin/activate` and `env/bin/activate_this.py`

- if you want to run sqlite3 locally, but mysql on a server, you have to list all the fields in the `settings.py` file, and set the env-vars for sqlite to 'null' for those entries not needed

- in `settings.py`...

        DATABASE_ENGINE = unicode( os.environ['DATABASE_ENGINE'] )       # Or path to database file if using sqlite3.
        DATABASE_NAME = unicode( os.environ['DATABASE_NAME'] )           # Or path to database file if using sqlite3.
        DATABASE_USER = unicode( os.environ['DATABASE_USER'] )           # Not used with sqlite3 (set env-var to 'null').
        DATABASE_PASSWORD = unicode( os.environ['DATABASE_PASSWORD'] )   # Not used with sqlite3.
        DATABASE_HOST = unicode( os.environ['DATABASE_HOST'] )           # Set to empty string for localhost. Not used with sqlite3.
        DATABASE_PORT = unicode( os.environ['DATABASE_PORT'] )           # Set to empty string for default. Not used with sqlite3.DATABASE_ENGINE = 'mysql'           # 'postgresql_psycopg2', 'postgresql', 'mysql', 'sqlite3' or 'oracle'.

- in the `env_settings.sh` file, for sqlite3, use 'null'...

        export DATABASE_ENGINE="sqlite3"
        export DATABASE_NAME="/path/to/project.db"
        export DATABASE_USER='null'
        export DATABASE_PASSWORD='null'
        export DATABASE_HOST='null'
        export DATABASE_PORT='null'

### virtualenv student environment work

- [step-by-step writeup of fairly manual install](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/usepweb_project/blob/master/README.md)

- somewhat unusual issue for this project: its dependency on web-calls to [data](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/usep-data) and [images](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/usep-images) outside of this project
    - the problem: those (127.0.0.1) calls violated Ajax's cross-domain-security-policy, because runserver uses 127.0.0.1:8000
    - the solution, thanks to a Joseph and Ben consult, is to use django's [STATICFILES_DIRS](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/settings/#std:setting-STATICFILES_DIRS) project-setting
        - by adding the `usep_web_stuff` directory -- which contained the `usep_data` and `usep_images` directories referenced in the code -- to the `STATICFILES_DIRS` list of paths, the web calls were treated as 127.0.0.1:8000 calls and all worked fine (see note below, though)

- gotcha #1 -- problemmatic settings file
    - I supplied the student with a runserver-friendly environmental settings file, and errors occurred sourcing it.
    - Turns out his editor, [Brackets](http://brackets.io) was interpreting the line endings as Windows-CRLF instead of Unix-LF.

- gotcha #2 -- the venerable [lxml](http://lxml.de) pip-installed fine, but choked on trying to use it:

  File "/Users/Zak/Documents/USEP/usep_project_stuff/usepweb_project/usep_app/models.py", line 15, in <module>

    from lxml import etree

        ImportError: dlopen(/Users/ZZZ/Documents/USEP/usep_project_stuff/env_usepweb/lib/python2.7/site-packages/lxml/etree.so, 2): Library not loaded: libxml2.2.dylib

          Referenced from: /Users/ZZZ/Documents/USEP/usep_project_stuff/env_usepweb/lib/python2.7/site-packages/lxml/etree.so

          Reason: Incompatible library version: etree.so requires version 12.0.0 or later, but libxml2.2.dylib provides version 10.0.0

    - the [solution](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23172384/lxml-runtime-error-reason-incompatible-library-version-etree-so-requires-vers/31607751#31607751)

- gotcha #3 -- I wanted to put the 'usep_web_stuff', containing 'usep_data' and 'usep_images', inside the general 'project_stuff' directory, but that did not work. Simply moving it outside of the 'project_stuff' directory, and updating the django `STATICFILES_DIRS` setting, worked.

### Ensuring localhost access

- focus is on my Mac, but ideas are unix
    - haven't actually confirmed these work because remote web access is already disabled (cuz firewall's on?, odd vpn ips?)

- httpd.conf (systemwide)
    - change `Listen 80` to `Listen 127.0.0.1:80`
    - does not require the port to be listen in the url
    - [serverfault source](http://serverfault.com/questions/276963/make-apache-only-accessible-via-127-0-0-1-is-this-possible/276968#276968)

- single project
    - add `Require local`
        - not sure of the context - passes 'configtest' when I add it to my passenger entry:

            `<Location /url_root>`

    - [stackoverflow source](http://stackoverflow.com/a/26556483)
    - [referenced apache documentation](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/mod/mod_authz_host.html)

### mod_wsgi & passenger

- Goal: have `http://library.brown.edu/projects/usep...` urls be handled by passenger, while leaving other `http://library.brown.edu/projects...` urls to be handled by existing mod_wsgi

- Tried a bunch of things that didn't work. Hunch was that perhaps there are two separate lists of urls that apache monitors for python-handoff, and it's not clear how it decides between the two (we experimented with load-order)

- What did work: switched all `http://library.brown.edu/projects...` urls to be handled by passenger, then we could reliably control handing off to the new usep code for `projects/usep...`, while leaving the rest of `projects...` to hand off to the old projects code.

- Surprising note: the order-of-entries in the passenger-conf was _opposite_ what we expected. Here's the order that works in the passenger.conf file...

        <Location /projects>
            PassengerBaseURI /projects
            PassengerAppType wsgi
            PassengerAppRoot /path/to/projects/apache
            PassengerPython /path/to/projects_env/bin/python
        </Location>
        <Location /projects/usep>
            PassengerBaseURI /projects
            PassengerAppType wsgi
            PassengerAppRoot /path/to/usepweb_project/config
            PassengerPython /path/to/env_usepweb/bin/python
        </Location>

### passenger config error helper

- issue: If something's wrong in the early loading of the passenger_wsgi.py file, it can be hard to determine what the problem is. The responding web page may be blank or just say there was a problem.
    - on the Mac, underlying errors are usually displayed in an apache log, but on our devserver, they're often not (maybe due to differing passenger versions? or logging config?)

- solution: add the directive `PassengerFriendlyErrorPages on  # dev only!` in the project's `<Location /root_url>` entry.
