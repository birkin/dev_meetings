### python sets

- needed: way to find intersections between lists

- example usage:

        In [2]: from sets import Set
        /Users/birkin/Documents/Brown_Library/rapid_exports_stuff/env_rpd/bin/ipython:1: DeprecationWarning: the sets module is deprecated
          #!/Users/birkin/Documents/Brown_Library/rapid_exports_stuff/env_rpd/bin/python

        In [3]: a = Set( [ 1, 2, 4, 5 ] )

        In [4]: b = Set( [ 2, 3, 4, 6 ] )

        In [5]: a_not_in_b = a - b

        In [6]: a_not_in_b
        Out[6]: Set([1, 5])

        In [7]: b_not_in_a = b - a

        In [8]: b_not_in_a
        Out[8]: Set([3, 6])

### environmental vars & quoting

- [_terrific_ explanation of difference between single and double quotes](http://stackoverflow.com/a/13819996)

- using single quotes allows this kind of shell-setting entry...

        export BACKUP_SQL='
            INSERT INTO `destination_table` (`key`, `issn`, `start`, `end`, `location`, `call_number`)
            SELECT `key`, `issn`, `start`, `end`, `location`, `call_number`
            FROM `source_table`;
            '

    ...whereas double-quotes wouldn't work, since the '`' character would be interpreted as the beginning of a command

### ipython pasting

- %paste no longer needed

- sample to paste...

        import itertools, operator

        def _contigify_list( lst ):
            """ Converts sorted list entries into sub-lists that are contiguous.
                Eg: [ 1, 2, 4, 5 ] -> [ [1, 2], [4, 5] ]
                Credit: <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3149440/python-splitting-list-based-on-missing-numbers-in-a-sequence>
                Called by build_holdings_list() """
            contig_lst = []
            if lst == ['']:
                return contig_lst
            int_lst = [ int(x) for x in lst ]
            for k, g in itertools.groupby( enumerate(int_lst), lambda (i,x):i-x ):
                contig_lst.append( map(operator.itemgetter(1), g) )
            return contig_lst

- benefits: editing & re-editing (in addition to syntax-colorization)

### contiguous lists re-show

- blurb:

        """ Converts sorted list entries into sub-lists that are contiguous.

### send both bash output, and python output (called by bash) to a log file

- situation: we've seen this with our python rq calls; I came across another usage

- in a bash script, lines like this will send output to the desired log:

        echo "$(date +%Y-%d-%b_%H-%M-%S) - starting nightly script" >> $C_LOG_PATH

    ...but this will not:

        $C_PYTHON_PATH $C_PARSER_PATH $C_UPDATES_DIR_PATH >> $C_LOG_PATH

    ...any output from the python parser-script will output to the terminal

- the solution:

        $C_PYTHON_PATH $C_PARSER_PATH $C_UPDATES_DIR_PATH >> $C_LOG_PATH 2>&1

- great reference, [all about (bash) redirection](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO-3.html)

### sys.setdefault()

- situation, old code was throwing a UnicodeDecode error using a solr library.

- initial investigation...
    - looking through the code, I noticed a file, [sitecustomize.py](https://github.com/birkin/kochief_titles_project/blob/481e93136ba18ba0ccdee7d01af925c2a355cb6d/kochief/pylib/sitecustomize.py) which specified a default encoding of 'utf-8', with a suggestion to move that file to the site-packages directory.
    - i did that, and the solr-commit code worked -- but i didn't want that kind of path-dependency (_so_ easy to forget down the road) -- and i suspected that setdefault() was hiding a problem that should have been more explicitly fixed.
    - my reading indicated that's the case, but it wasn't clear, from a quick perusal of the codebase, whether the problem was in the old newtitles code, or in the old libraries used by the code.

- temporary solution: at the top of the [file being called](https://github.com/birkin/kochief_titles_project/blob/3d96ce1507c841ddf9aa8db23e10b96cebf9a3ec/kochief/discovery/parsers/brown_marc.py#L3-L6)...

        import sys
        if sys.getdefaultencoding() == 'ascii':
            reload(sys)
            sys.setdefaultencoding( 'utf-8' )  # hack; TODO, handle strings & unicode explicitly
