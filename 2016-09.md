### [pydio](https://pydio.com/en)

- filesharing and management; built w/php. Seems a private company, though its code appears to be [open-source](https://github.com/pydio) (restrictions on contributions).

- 'developer's guide' has a thorough [api](https://pydio.com/en/docs/developer-guide/using-pydio-api) that might be interesting to look at for ideas about structuring new file-management apis we might develop.

### passenger config note

- example of rare instance where our location entry is different from PassengerBaseURI:

        <Location /projects/software>
            PassengerBaseURI /projects
            PassengerAppType wsgi
            PassengerAppRoot /path/to/software_tracker_stuff/software_tracker_project/config
            PassengerPython /path/to/software_tracker_stuff/env_sftwr/bin/python
        </Location>

    In this project, the 'projects' part of the url was already being routed by apache to a different project, so the location definition had to be more specific. However, the software_tracker_project code depended on getting that 'software' part of the url, thus the difference.

### unicode discussion

- shared the funky '“iñtërnâtiønàlĭzætiФn”' string I came across long ago and have updated.

- notes...
    - include the curly quotes; they're  u\zzzz characters
    - keywords/tags: internationalization, unicode
    - non-lattin chars:
        - ø -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%98
        - æ -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86
        - Ф -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ef_(Cyrillic)
