### passenger config note

- example of rare instance where our location entry is different from PassengerBaseURI:

        <Location /projects/software>
            PassengerBaseURI /projects
            PassengerAppType wsgi
            PassengerAppRoot /path/to/software_tracker_stuff/software_tracker_project/config
            PassengerPython /path/to/software_tracker_stuff/env_sftwr/bin/python
        </Location>

    In this project, the 'projects' part of the url was already being routed by apache to a different project, so the location definition had to be more specific. However, the software_tracker_project code depended on getting that 'software' part of the url, thus the difference.

### unicode discussion

- shared the funky '“iñtërnâtiônàlĭzætiøn”' string I came across long ago.

(keyword: internationalization)
