### jobs.code4lib.org -> freebase -> knowledge-graph

- [announcement](https://lists.clir.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1610&L=CODE4LIB&F=&S=&P=58578) that [jobs.code4lib.org](http://jobs.code4lib.org) was going to be shutdown, in part because of google retiring the [freebase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freebase) api, led me to hear about the [google knowledge graph api](https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph/), and I wondered if anyone has used it, and am interested in brainstorming how it might be used in our projects.
