### logging: config

(meeting cancelled; not yet discussed)

- [my typical script-based code](https://github.com/birkin/annex_receipts/blob/c0f4e6b3fa22558866825ddc13dca86aed1117ce/Controller.py#L37-L43)

- annoying issue with above: the need for the `lvl_dct` there, but that's needed because `logging.basicConfig()` takes a level parameter that's an object (i.e. `logging.INFO`), not a string -- and I can only really pass in strings in an env variable.

- there _is_ as of python 2.7 a more modern way to configure logging. Instead of basicConfig(), there's a [dictConfig()](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/logging.config.html#logging.config.dictConfig) approach.

- I haven't used the above because

    - I've found the python [documentation]((https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/logging.config.html#logging.config.dictConfig)) for it a bit dense

    - Some of the examples I've come across have still used the `logging.DEBUG` object -- which defeats the purpose of allowing strings. And this includes an example from a [hero](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/logging/#example-configuration-via-a-dictionary).   :(

    - As in the github example shown, some servers still only offer python 2.6, which doesn't, as I understand, allow for dictConfig() configuration.

- But [here's an example](https://fangpenlin.com/posts/2012/08/26/good-logging-practice-in-python/) that shows how one could use dictConfig() with python 2.7 (search on dictConfig() -- the section's about 2/3 of the way down the page)

    - This would allow for an entire dict to be passed in (via a json string), or just specific setting string-values for level and path, such as in my [django-projects](https://github.com/birkin/callnumber_project/blob/2bf139292b90b3e4193454f7fa6bb460acd886ec/config/settings.py#L127-L155).
