============

### github to django

- [iip webhook](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/iip-texts/settings/hooks/11528275)

- checkout `Recent Deliveries`, and note the elipsis next to each.
    - clicking that shows a `Redeliver` button, useful for testing without having to actually make a dummy change to data.
