2017-Aug-25 - dev meeting
=========================

### error-log cleanup thought

- Perhaps, on one day during the off-sprint week, we all take a look at production apache error logs -- and clean up something of ours.

    - There are lots of logs, but two places to start...

            $ tail -500f ./error_log

            $ tail -500f ./ssl_error_log

- some of my cleanup...

    - Set django logging to `'propagate': False` either [directly](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/xsl_transformer_project/blob/61f4a0e7f6dacd6fdc50e87e09b0ead88b35e958/config/settings.py#L132) -- or via a [setting](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/easyaccess_project/blob/2d049be8b626358cbe2768ab15eb200b91a37b15/config/settings.py#L155-L156)

### 'setting' loaded by js?

- Issue: in our hay-aeon implementation for [classic-josiah](https://github.com/birkin/hay_aeon_classic_js/blob/6d6c19ac42f0dce666aeb4a352d0c37b788f0228/hay_aeon_classic.js#L85-L86) and [new-josiah](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/bul-search/blob/167de8e57a9a34b62d5f46dd143dd101ff08215f/app/assets/javascripts/application.js#L159-L164) , there are a list of hay locations to exclude. The problem is that they're currently hard-coded into the js.

- Question: what are some good ways to handle this?

    - If django/rails is producing/writing the js, then that data could be loaded from settings.

    - But what about perhaps having a simple hay_exclusions.json file somewhere on the server that could be loaded and acted upon by the regular hay-aeon js code? Other ideas?

### student notes thought...

- we've come up with improved installs; we can do more, but progress has been made
    - [us-epigraphy](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/usepweb_project#student-developer-installation)
    - [theater-that-was-rome](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/ttwr#install-and-run)

- what about other stuff?
    - I've kept [notes](https://github.com/birkin/summer_iip_dev_notes/blob/master/notes.md) about my work with the iip summer students, and there's stuff in there worth sharing in the future -- kind of like a handbook on [good software-development practices](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qzb3wulrxhp4QxwZDLkU7jUYu1vHhzw7ReegGmwIEhE/edit#gid=0), covering areas like:
    - github tips
        - script for updating servers
        - stable urls to lines
        - using issues
        - keeping master working
    - update dev or production _frequently_
    - settings and .gitignore good practices
    - logrotation


### testing js implementation...

- uses 'selenium' ([software-site](http://www.seleniumhq.org)) ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_(software)))

- [functional-testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_testing) for handoff from [classic-josiah](http://josiah.brown.edu) to [Aeon](https://www.atlas-sys.com/aeon/) special-collections software

- classic-josiah [hay-aeon](https://github.com/birkin/hay_aeon_classic_js/blob/master/selenium_tests.py) and [jcb-aeon](https://github.com/birkin/jcb_link_js/blob/master/selenium_tests.py) tests
    - [simple param checks](https://github.com/birkin/jcb_link_js/blob/40595d9030e92f50773c4ec4404256c3bbafa7e3/selenium_tests.py#L35-L40)
    - more specific [parsed-param checks](https://github.com/birkin/jcb_link_js/blob/40595d9030e92f50773c4ec4404256c3bbafa7e3/selenium_tests.py#L35-L40)
