2017-Aug-11 - dev meeting
=========================


### student notes thought...

- we've come up with improved installs; we can do more, but progress has been made
    - [us-epigraphy](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/usepweb_project#student-developer-installation)
    - [theater-that-was-rome](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/ttwr#install-and-run)

- what about other stuff?
    - I've kept [notes](https://github.com/birkin/summer_iip_dev_notes/blob/master/notes.md) about my work with the iip summer students, and there's stuff in there worth sharing in the future -- kind of like a handbook on [good software-development practices](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qzb3wulrxhp4QxwZDLkU7jUYu1vHhzw7ReegGmwIEhE/edit#gid=0), covering areas like:
    - github tips
        - script for updating servers
        - stable urls to lines
        - using issues
        - keeping master working
    - update dev or production _frequently_
    - settings and .gitignore good practices
    - logrotation


### testing js implementation...

- uses 'selenium' ([software-site](http://www.seleniumhq.org)) ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_(software)))

- [functional-testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_testing) for handoff from [classic-josiah](http://josiah.brown.edu) to [Aeon](https://www.atlas-sys.com/aeon/) special-collections software

- classic-josiah [hay-aeon](https://github.com/birkin/hay_aeon_classic_js/blob/master/selenium_tests.py) and [jcb-aeon](https://github.com/birkin/jcb_link_js/blob/master/selenium_tests.py) tests
    - [simple param checks](https://github.com/birkin/jcb_link_js/blob/40595d9030e92f50773c4ec4404256c3bbafa7e3/selenium_tests.py#L35-L40)
    - more specific [parsed-param checks](https://github.com/birkin/jcb_link_js/blob/40595d9030e92f50773c4ec4404256c3bbafa7e3/selenium_tests.py#L35-L40)
