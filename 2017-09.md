### J.M. proxy work

- issue
    - for webapps, we're proxying production-server 'A' calls to firewalled-server 'B'
    - django has built-in [cross-site-request-forgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) protection
        - from that wikipedia link: "...Unlike cross-site scripting (XSS), which exploits the trust a user has for a particular site, CSRF exploits the trust that a site has in a user's browser...."
    - the protection gets triggered when posting a form, because the code running on server 'B' can tell the form came from server 'A'
    - django 1.9 offers a way around this: [specifying trusted domains](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/settings/#csrf-trusted-origins)

=========================


### go indirectly-related gems

- [online interactive shell](https://play.golang.org)
    - i initially used a different one

- design constraints
    - unused imports
    - unused variables
    - programmatic formatting

- deepens my sense of python paradigms, like "What does it [really mean](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2012/11/13/is-python-callbyvalue-or-callbyreference-neither/) to pass a variable/argument to a function?"

- [quality-metrics displays](https://github.com/trending/go)
    - [project](https://github.com/json-iterator/go/blob/master/README.md) with [go report](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/json-iterator/go)
    - [project](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/master/README.md) with [best-practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/88)
        - like the gsheet idea but more connected to the code.

- learning [koans](https://github.com/cdarwin/go-koans)
    - and [python](https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans/tree/master/python3/koans) and [ruby](http://rubykoans.com), too


### power of context
