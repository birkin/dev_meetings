### passwordless web-logins?

- learning go, stumbled across [go code for passwordless web-logins](https://github.com/nogopass/nogopass)

- the readme refers to a really [thought-provoking blog-post](http://notes.xoxco.com/post/27999787765/is-it-time-for-password-less-login) on the benefits.

- thought: this could be a lightweight authNZ solution to projects that require both Brown and non-Brown participants

- other implementations: [django](https://github.com/relekang/django-nopassword), [rails](https://github.com/alsmola/nopassword)
