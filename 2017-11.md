2017-Nov-10 - dev meeting
=========================

### E.M.'s "documentation" point

- she brought up TEI's transparency

- made me think of golang's issue [discussion around time](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/12914)
    - note github's nice user-interface issue for such long threads (search page on "items not shown")

- EM's point was that it's useful to capture context/historical-context. I think that can be done in different ways. Here are two of my projects with vastly different README files, one somewhat meeting this goal, the other definitely _not_:
    - [easyAccess](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/iip_processing_project)
        - this mostly provides informative context rather than historical context -- but does link to the [easyBorrow project](https://github.com/birkin/easyborrow_controller), which provides some of that
    - [iip-processing](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/iip_processing_project)


### rounding

- any guesses as to the results of these python commands?

        >>> round( 2.5 )
        >>> round( 3.5 )

- [fascinating S.O. info](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10825926/python-3-x-rounding-behavior), if you've never heard of `banker's rounding`


### code-quality-constellation update

- [code repo](https://github.com/birkin/bul_cbp_project)

- last time I showed how I'd gotten the image to work, creating, in markdown, the syntax to generate (i.e.):

        <a href="https://library.brown.edu/bul_cbp/project_info/best-practices/">
            <img alt="BUL Best Practices" src="https://library.brown.edu/bul_cbp/project_image/best-practices/" />
        </a>

- current features
    - dynamic score
    - dynamic color
    - incorporates time
    - public / non-public info
    - sad-facets (filters!)

- todo before beta (next sprint off-week)
    - main
        - real db
    - other
        - E.M.'s documentation context!
        - easy one-step shib-login

- brainstorming -- what could be done
    - monthly summary emails to developers of to-dos
    - don't show score below x% -- just color indicator

2017-Nov-03 - dev meeting
=========================


### passwordless web-logins?

- learning go, stumbled across [go code for passwordless web-logins](https://github.com/nogopass/nogopass)

- the readme refers to a really [thought-provoking blog-post](http://notes.xoxco.com/post/27999787765/is-it-time-for-password-less-login) on the benefits.

- thought: this could be a lightweight authNZ solution to projects that require both Brown and non-Brown participants

- other implementations: [django](https://github.com/relekang/django-nopassword), [rails](https://github.com/alsmola/nopassword)


### tableau workshop thought

- P.R. is offering a [tableau workshop](http://brownlibrary.lwcal.com/#event_id/99/view/event/date/20171114) Tuesday November 14 from 1pm-2:30pm. Thought (we should run this by Patrick): a couple of us go (not taking up official spots) to perhaps get a sense of how we might create data feeds for a future tableau-based Library dashboard.


### shib 'entity' reporting

- Reference exchange w/S.C.
