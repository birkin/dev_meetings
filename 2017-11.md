=========================


### passwordless web-logins?

- learning go, stumbled across [go code for passwordless web-logins](https://github.com/nogopass/nogopass)

- the readme refers to a really [thought-provoking blog-post](http://notes.xoxco.com/post/27999787765/is-it-time-for-password-less-login) on the benefits.

- thought: this could be a lightweight authNZ solution to projects that require both Brown and non-Brown participants

- other implementations: [django](https://github.com/relekang/django-nopassword), [rails](https://github.com/alsmola/nopassword)


### tableau workshop thought

- P.R. is offering a [tableau workshop](http://brownlibrary.lwcal.com/#event_id/99/view/event/date/20171114) Tuesday November 14 from 1pm-2:30pm. Thought (we should run this by Patrick): a couple of us go (not taking up official spots) to perhaps get a sense of how we might create data feeds for a future tableau-based Library dashboard.


### shib 'entity' reporting

- Reference exchange w/S.C.
