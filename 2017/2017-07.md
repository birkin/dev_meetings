### making a temporary copy of a file...

- normal flow:
    - if file is a tiff, make a jp2 using the [kakadu library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakadu_(software))

- problem: kakadu can't handle filenames with commas, and some of our filenames have them
    - note, we didn't want to touch the client's original file

- solution flow:
    - make a copy of the tiff with a valid kakadu filename
    - make the jp2 using the copied-tiff's filename

- so what's cool?
    - python has a nice built-in [`tempfile` library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html) to create a temporary file that will auto-disappear when you don't need it anymore
    - python also has a nice built-in [library for copying files](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html) (it does other things with files, too)
    - we figured out a way to use both, so the copy 'destination' could be a file that:
        1. offered a filepath that kakadu could reference
        2. would nicely disappear when we were finished (so we wouldn't have to write cleanup code)
    - [the code](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/bell/blob/556d4353d08b0fba2163bb78dea6fce1fd1bfa34/tasks/images.py#L240-L246)
