2017-Oct-27 - dev meeting
=========================

### providence geeks

- new-ish folk: [Providence Geeks upcoming events](https://www.facebook.com/pg/providencegeeks/events/)
    - no upcoming events at this moment, but there will be -- let's consider going down as a group sometime!


### visualizing pubmed searches

- <https://esperr.github.io/visualizingpubmed/>
    - includes visualizations by category, subheading, medline-maps, pubmed-by-year, and pubmed venn-diagrams

- one example: a pubmed-by-year search on [myopia and astigmatism](https://esperr.github.io/pubmed-by-year/?q1=myopia&q2=astigmatism)
    - note that clicking on a dot executes the pub-med search with the year-limit ([example](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=myopia+AND+2002[DP]))

- Nora noted another cool jstor beta visualization tool: <http://www.jstor.org/analyze/>
    - note: my safari ad-blocker prevented the default demo-drag
