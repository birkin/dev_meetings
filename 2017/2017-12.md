### elegant envars

##### issue...

- _Activating_ a virtual-environment does two things.
    1. it provides access to the specified version of python and python-packages
    1. it loads environmental-variables needed by the application

- _Deactivating_ a virtual environment
    1. disables access to the virtual-environment's python and python-packages
    1. but does __not__ remove the application environmental-variables from the post-deactivation environment

- This can, on occasion, bite you. An example...

    - you set a log-path for the application in an environmental variable (this is outside of your code):

        `$ export APP_A__LOG="/foo/bar.log"`

    - in an application setting-file (part of your code) you load that envar:

        `LOG_PATH = os.environ['APP_A__LOG']`

    - while working you realize some of your settings are to directories and some are to files, so you do a quick mini-refactor to make the log envar more explicit. You do that by changing the name of the envar:

        `$ export APP_A__LOGFILE="/foo/bar.log"`

        ...and you __intend__ to update the application setting-file to:

        `LOG_PATH = os.environ['APP_A__LOGFILE']`

        ...but you forget to do that second step.

    - you deactivate and re-activate the environment to load the new environmental variable, work away, and everything works fine! So you're ready to move your changes from your localbox to the dev-server. You update the shell or 'activate' file that loads the new envar name, and git-pull any code changes -- and your app, appropriately does __not__ work -- telling you, correctly and appropriately, that there is no environmental-variable `APP_A__LOG`.

    - the reason is because you didn't notice the error in your localdev environment is because the old envar name never went away -- hiding from you your error of forgetting to update the application settings file.

##### solution...

- When you activate an environment, you source an 'activate' file. That file contains a deactivate() function.

- Add this line to the end of the function:

        unset $(env | grep APP_A__ | cut -d= -f1 | xargs)

    ...where 'APP_A__' is the app-specific prefix you use for your envars. That's it!

##### credit...

- my preparation for the CLPS python bootcamp led me to some [conda virtual-environment documentation](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#macos-and-linux) that indicated that conda has an actual deactivate file where code can be added. The examples showed explicit UNSET -ing of envars. I knew I never, ever should try to manually maintain an explict list of unset files -- but it gave me the idea to trigger shell-code which would look for a specified prefix and iterate through them.

- i mentioned this to J.M. and successfully ferrissed him beyond my wildest dreams -- the code's all his!  :)
