### controller flow

- Two flow possibilities occurred to me for an additional BorrowDirect lookup; which should I have chosen?

    - specify the main BorrowDirect flow, and handle the two implementations within that. That's the [curent implementation](https://github.com/birkin/easyborrow_controller/blob/call_new_bd_api/EzBorrowController.py#L117) I chose.


    - alternate thought: add the alternate flow to an additional [flow-list](https://github.com/birkin/easyborrow_controller/blob/call_new_bd_api/EzBorrowController.py#L307-L326) entry.
