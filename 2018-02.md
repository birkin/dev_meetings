### grouper issue

- issue: J.M. and I realized recently that grouper-groups don't seem to have been maintained as we'd thought. For internal admin links, I often use two or three grouper-groups that I've been assuming cover our tech group -- but don't.

- recommendation: Let's all examine our [shib groups](https://library.brown.edu/easyaccess/find/my_info/), and work with our grouper-admin access and CIS to ensure we have the granular tech groups we need, as well as, perhaps, an overall digital-technologies group.

### django admin list-view

- issue: some fields were too long, resulting in the need to scroll horizontally (horrors!)

- one solution: override the field-presentation-specification in the admin ([implementation link](https://github.com/birkin/site_checker_project/blob/0c97a5954b9f10afaa303705dfdbe5630563b1d5/site_checker_app/admin.py#L12-L20))
    - B.C.: I read the [__documentation__](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_display)!!
