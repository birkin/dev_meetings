- annex page-slip exports
    - [data-prep](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/josiah_print_pageslips/blob/378aa425aa90ffdf5dd5201062d087692b019fb5/FileSaveController.py#L52)
    - [data-transfer](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/josiah_print_pageslips/blob/378aa425aa90ffdf5dd5201062d087692b019fb5/FileTransferController.py#L57)

- nightly exports
    - [code-gist](https://gist.github.com/birkin/c7da04ce10507ffd0c9d10da8d8dbd9c#file-iii_export-py-L349-L361)
    - interesting issue
        - page-slips transferred fine, but nightly-exports would hang on the 3rd or 4th file-export intermittently. Why?
        - turns out the SFTP module doesn't only have separate export commands, but it uses queuing, which shows different menu options depending upon how many items are in the queue.
