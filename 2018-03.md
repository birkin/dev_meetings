### annex-hay demo

- note gdrive doc with pics of drawings & screenshot

### css

- issue: the template-css I [used to use](https://library.brown.edu/easyaccess/find/) looks dusty and shabby and unkempt compared to [new-josiah's](https://search.library.brown.edu/catalog/?f[format][]=Book&q=zen+motorcycle) clean whitespace fresh look

- end-result, [example](https://library.brown.edu/sitechecker/status/)

- pros
    - it looks _awesome_
    - it matches new-josiah -- one of our most heavily-used pages
    - it providedes consistency (rows 1 & 2) _and_ flexibility (row 3)

- cons
    - maintainability

- solution
    - I want to get [ben & joseph's bulstyle](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/django-bulstyle) package working -- or an updated fork of it

2018-Mar-01 â€” sprint-share
==========================

### making millennium talk

- annex page-slip exports
    - [data-prep](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/josiah_print_pageslips/blob/378aa425aa90ffdf5dd5201062d087692b019fb5/FileSaveController.py#L52)
    - [data-transfer](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/josiah_print_pageslips/blob/378aa425aa90ffdf5dd5201062d087692b019fb5/FileTransferController.py#L57)

- nightly exports
    - [code-gist](https://gist.github.com/birkin/c7da04ce10507ffd0c9d10da8d8dbd9c#file-iii_export-py-L349-L361)
    - interesting issue
        - page-slips transferred fine, but nightly-exports would hang on the 3rd or 4th file-export intermittently. Why?
        - turns out the SFTP module doesn't only have separate export commands, but it uses queuing, which shows different menu options depending upon how many items are in the queue.
