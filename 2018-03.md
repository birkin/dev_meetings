### yes, was turbolinks

- the [removal](https://github.com/birkin/bul_cbp_project/commit/6a3bab34242f3efd9cde442d68dfa84b4559a577)
    - _acknowledgment: this js contains boatloads of unnecessary stuff -- it's a goal to dramatically simplify it_

---

### svg escaping

- issue: I wanted to make non-logged-in low-score displays display `< 75%`, with logged-in displays showing the actual number. But passing in the '<' was generating an error.
- solution: svg is just xml; so just had to use the proper [entity-reference](https://github.com/birkin/bul_cbp_project/blob/e72c7b1aef2be10a97225c5659af2134b03a4d5d/bul_cbp_app/views.py#L91-L94) for the less-than symbol.

### cool use of websocket-ish communication

- [problem-report link](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/django-users/p9NewsiCGW8)
- [example of communication](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fimgur.com%2Fa%2FqRJv8&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNE84NB_OJVIdFAXd78Z58tr7OznpQ) (and eventual problem)

### sqlite3 dev-db to cis mysql-db

- in the past I've exported sql, then tweaked the sql a bit, then imported the sql via phpMyAdmin. BC reminded me of django's [dumpdata](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/django-admin/#dumpdata), which I'd used in the past for [fixtures](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/django-admin/#what-s-a-fixture) -- and it worked fabulously, nicely abstracting the db differences.

- the commands

    - `(env_active)$ python ./manage.py dumpdata app_name.ModelName > /path/to/output.json`

    - `(env_active)$ python ./manage.py loaddata /path/to/output.json`

- NOTE: I have to confirm this -- but I believe this process _by default_, __replaces__ existing data. This is what I wanted, but may not be desired. The default json output contains primary-keys, but I see that the dumpdata command can take an [additional argument](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/django-admin/#cmdoption-dumpdata-natural-primary), `--natural-primary`, which "Omits the primary key in the serialized data of this object since it can be calculated during deserialization."

### managing frameworks / standardizing development tools

- question i recently received...

    _...[A colleague and] I have been wrestling lately with how best to manage (keep up with) framework versions and standardizing development tools. For example, we have applications built using multiple versions of Laravel, each of which has its own quirks, and any time we start on a new app, we tend to start from scratch grabbing whatever the latest is. I have some rough ideas on how we might improve this, but wanted to see what thoughts you might have. Is this something you’ve come up with any tools or techniques for in the Library?..._

- my answer...

    - we've adopted the practice to use only django [long-term-support (LTS) versions](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/#supported-versions) (credit to B.C.)

    - so looking at that url, I'll start any new django project with version 1.11.x, and won't use a version 2.x version of django until the 2.2 LTS version comes out next year.

    - the most obvious benefit of LTS versions is, of course, the longer-term commitment to patch vulnerabilities. But it also has the effect of making our development/upgrade process much saner.

    - Other?

### annex-hay demo

- note gdrive doc with pics of drawings & screenshot

### css

- issue: the template-css I [used to use](https://library.brown.edu/easyaccess/find/) looks dusty and shabby and unkempt compared to [new-josiah's](https://search.library.brown.edu/catalog/?f[format][]=Book&q=zen+motorcycle) clean whitespace fresh look

- end-result, [example](https://library.brown.edu/sitechecker/status/)

- pros
    - it looks _awesome_
    - it matches new-josiah -- one of our most heavily-used pages
    - it providedes consistency (rows 1 & 2) _and_ flexibility (row 3)

- cons
    - maintainability

- solution
    - I want to get [ben & joseph's bulstyle](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/django-bulstyle) package working -- or an updated fork of it

==========================

### making millennium talk

- annex page-slip exports
    - [data-prep](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/josiah_print_pageslips/blob/378aa425aa90ffdf5dd5201062d087692b019fb5/FileSaveController.py#L52)
    - [data-transfer](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/josiah_print_pageslips/blob/378aa425aa90ffdf5dd5201062d087692b019fb5/FileTransferController.py#L57)

- nightly exports
    - [code-gist](https://gist.github.com/birkin/c7da04ce10507ffd0c9d10da8d8dbd9c#file-iii_export-py-L349-L361)
    - interesting issue
        - page-slips transferred fine, but nightly-exports would hang on the 3rd or 4th file-export intermittently. Why?
        - turns out the SFTP module doesn't only have separate export commands, but it uses queuing, which shows different menu options depending upon how many items are in the queue.
