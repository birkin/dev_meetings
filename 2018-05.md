### trio

- origin: B.C. post to slack on this (long) [post](https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/)
    - it's one of those wonderful articles that gives you fresh insight into the work you already do.
    - it's Yet Another concurrency library -- but with a deep commitment to interface, not just functionality

- some play, taking code from somewhere internal to the [project](https://github.com/python-trio/trio) -- I think in the [documentation](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    - [simple print-outs](https://github.com/birkin/trio_exp_code/blob/master/main.py) of execution-flow
    - [failed attempt](https://github.com/birkin/trio_exp_code/blob/master/main02.py) at capturing children's work output
    - [successful attempt](https://github.com/birkin/trio_exp_code/blob/master/main03.py) at capturing children's work output

=========================

### programmatic email access

- note re email address

- [code](https://github.com/birkin/transfer_annex_pageslips) -- some interesting quirks...
    - email_obj.items() does not contain the message-body -- [code-link](https://github.com/birkin/transfer_annex_pageslips/blob/9e08ab4c12aee34e5251a8313fa72c3b602d3c41/main.py#L187)
    - Parts of the email indicate it should be utf8-encoded, but trying to read it that way failed. The package [chardet](http://chardet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html) worked in this case -- [code](https://github.com/birkin/transfer_annex_pageslips/blob/9e08ab4c12aee34e5251a8313fa72c3b602d3c41/main.py#L204-L206).
    - Can't compare naive and time-zone aware dates -- [conversion code](https://github.com/birkin/transfer_annex_pageslips/blob/9e08ab4c12aee34e5251a8313fa72c3b602d3c41/main.py#L61-L62) using [pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/)
