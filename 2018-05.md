===========================

### re-automating annex-requests

- problem: Upgrade to Sierra broke our system of auto-processing annex-requests
- solution: [graphic-link](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/16TnFmWn4hhrmL0e-F8jNf2MqKB5Vz45c_AIzo13dEjU/edit)
    - auto-notices exports annex-requests with pageslip-data embedded in email
    - watcher code looks for new annex-requests, extracts pageslip data and deposits it on the Annex server
    - other watcher code looks for new pageslip data, archives and parses it, and feeds it to the Annex inventory-control software

### adding blacklight links for annex-hay requests

- [bib result page](http://dblightcit.services.brown.edu/find/catalog/b1696945)
- [search-results page](http://dblightcit.services.brown.edu/find/catalog?f%5Bbuilding_facet%5D%5B%5D=Annex&f%5Bformat%5D%5B%5D=Book&q=lincoln&search_field=all_fields)
    - shows a mix of locations, with "ANNEX HAY" locations properly displaying the link
- [search-results page #2](http://dblightcit.services.brown.edu/find/catalog?utf8=%E2%9C%93&f%5Bbuilding_facet%5D%5B%5D=Annex&search_field=all_fields&q=canfield)
    - shows annex-hay items that are requestable, and one that is _not_, because of the `Archives/Manuscripts` format -- see title: "Eli Hawley Canfield papers, 1844-1898"

2018-May-18 - dev-meeting
=========================

### trio

- origin: B.C. post to slack on this (long) [post](https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/)
    - it's one of those wonderful articles that gives you fresh insight into the work you already do.
    - it's Yet Another concurrency library -- but with a deep commitment to interface, not just functionality

- some play, taking code from somewhere internal to the [project](https://github.com/python-trio/trio) -- I think in the [documentation](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    - [simple print-outs](https://github.com/birkin/trio_exp_code/blob/master/main.py) of execution-flow
    - [failed attempt](https://github.com/birkin/trio_exp_code/blob/master/main02.py) at capturing children's work output
    - [successful attempt](https://github.com/birkin/trio_exp_code/blob/master/main03.py) at capturing children's work output

2018-May-04 - dev-meeting
=========================

### programmatic email access

- note re email address

- [code](https://github.com/birkin/transfer_annex_pageslips) -- some interesting quirks...
    - email_obj.items() does not contain the message-body -- [code-link](https://github.com/birkin/transfer_annex_pageslips/blob/9e08ab4c12aee34e5251a8313fa72c3b602d3c41/main.py#L187)
    - Parts of the email indicate it should be utf8-encoded, but trying to read it that way failed. The package [chardet](http://chardet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html) worked in this case -- [code](https://github.com/birkin/transfer_annex_pageslips/blob/9e08ab4c12aee34e5251a8313fa72c3b602d3c41/main.py#L204-L206).
    - Can't compare naive and time-zone aware dates -- [conversion code](https://github.com/birkin/transfer_annex_pageslips/blob/9e08ab4c12aee34e5251a8313fa72c3b602d3c41/main.py#L61-L62) using [pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/)

### marc export code

(repeated because not shown before)

- [code](https://github.com/birkin/sierra_big_export_code)
- readme describes flow
- feedback on [tracker](https://library.brown.edu/josiah/sierra_big_exports/tracker.json)?
