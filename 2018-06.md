==========================

### annex-hay forced re-authentication

- issue:
    - my previous 'forced-reauthentication' flow worked pretty well, but had a couple drawbacks

- old forced-reauthentication flow
    - first, what user sees:
        - page to confirm their request
        - shib-login
        - ending confirmation page that their request was successful
    - what really happens
        - behind-the-scenes redirects user to the SP login url, with a 'return' param to my shib-handler page
        - my shib-handler page checks shib headers and redirects user to a behind-the-scenes 'processor' page
            - this does the desired work -- in this case placing a request via Sierra
        - then behind-the-scenes it redirects them to the IDP logout url, with a 'return' param to my logout-handler page
        - my logout-handler page then displays a success/confirmation page

- better annex-hay forced-reauthenticaton flow
    - first, what user sees (same simple flow as before):
        - page to confirm their request
        - shib-login
        - Aeon page
    - what realy happens
        - behind-the-scenes redirects user to the IDP logout url, with a 'return' param to my logout-handler page
        - my logout-handler page, behind-the-scenes, redirects user to the SP login url, with a 'return' param to my shib-handler page
        - my shib-handler page checks shib headers and redirects user to a behind-the-scenes 'processor' page
            - this does the desired work:
                - palces a request via Sierra
                - redirects user to Aeon pre-filled-out form (with a note for staff that the Sierra request was placed, with the item-number)

- benefits
    - old system did not force reauthentication the very first time -- the new flow does
    - the new flow leaves users logged in to shibboleth, so they can take advantage of the benefits of single sign-on to the next place they go.

### running flask locally

- issue:
    - running locally via passenger had spoiled me; got out of the habit of using django's `runserver` and don't remember how I used to run flask locally.
    - last os upgrade broke passenger, and I got in the habit of runserver for django, but hadn't updated a flask project

- solution:
    - flask now has a runserver-style feature!
    - documentation: <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/> search on `flask run`
    - not available before v0.10 or v0.11
