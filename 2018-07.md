### quick version check

##### Issue...

When starting work on an existing project, one of the first things I want to do is ensure the localdev (my laptop) version of the code is the same as the dev-server version, and is the same as the production-server version. (Or see that they're not the same and determine why.)

This usually has meant logging into the servers, cd-ing to the code directory, and running `git branch -a` and `git log`. It's do-able, but often feels like a little too much overhead for the simple thing I want to check.

##### Solution...

A while ago, I added an 'info' url to the template from which I start my new projects -- and often add a lightweight one when revisiting a project. J.M. has found this useful when doing migrations or troubleshooting and is looking for an app url to make sure the app is working. By default, the info url just returns json of `datetime.datetime.now()` (and logs that), so I can quickly see that my new django app is responding and logging correctly.

So, for a project I worked on recently, I implemented an additional dictionary entry to the info url -- `version`. Here's an example:

The call: <https://library.brown.edu/titles/info/>

...which returns:

        {
          "request": {
            "timestamp": "2018-07-27 13:04:29.424830",
            "url": "http://library.brown.edu/titles//titles/info/"
          },
          "response": {
            "timetaken": "0:00:00.110902",
            "version": "master d8df7547958f53ba822b1833967929b4ebb93842"
          }
        }

This turned out to be relatively simple: running a `subprocess` command to get the [commit](https://github.com/birkin/kochief_titles_project/blob/d8df7547958f53ba822b1833967929b4ebb93842/kochief/discovery/lib/info_helper.py#L20), another to get the [branch](https://github.com/birkin/kochief_titles_project/blob/d8df7547958f53ba822b1833967929b4ebb93842/kochief/discovery/lib/info_helper.py#L35), and putting them [together](https://github.com/birkin/kochief_titles_project/blob/d8df7547958f53ba822b1833967929b4ebb93842/kochief/discovery/views.py#L62).

### lazy troubleshooting

##### Issue...

An old project had stopped working due to a server migration. I recently got it working again, and then decided to upgrade the project's version of django.

It was a big jump and I addressed the usual such issues. But one stumped me for a while. In retrospect, I can now see that had I paid more attention to the traceback, I could have zeroed in on the location of the problem more quickly. But the traceback contained solely django & python error entries -- rather than indicators of where in _my_ code the problem lay -- so I dove into the view function in question and added logging. And added more logging. And more.

The surprising issue was that the view was returning a _good_ response -- yet the error persisted.

##### Solution...

By forcing a `return HttpResponse( 'foo' )` at various places in the code, I narrowed the possibilities. It turned out that the code was updating the session, and one element of the updated session was a datetime object. That object is not serializable in the current version of django, but was in the earlier version. The tricky part was that the session-update was only processed by the django middleware _after_ the response had been returned.

My take-aways...
- Treat library-only tracebacks more like a grownup.
- Be aware of how what I 'know' can get in the way of troubleshooting.
- Be aware of [lazy evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation). Django does this in a few places, most notably in it's [database-query code](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/db/queries/#querysets-are-lazy). And perhaps this example -- where the set-session code created an object acted on later -- isn't exactly an issue of lazy-evaluation. But it's conceptually similar, and my discernment was slowed by the non-procedural timing of the blow-up.

Minor aside: one of the tracebacks showed the failure occuring on the attempt by django to serialize the datetime object, and I could see from the code-snippet in the traceback that a JSONSerializer class was attempting to encode to 'latin-1'. The encoding had nothing to do with the error but threw me for a loop (as a passionate unicode/utf-8 evangelist). But it's not the main `json.dumps` serializer -- it's one specifically for url-safe actions. The [class](https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/core/signing.py#L81-L90); the [explanation](https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/core/signing.py#L2-L7).

### P.I.I. removal

- logic:
    - get old requests with user info
    - create an updated [clean-demographic dct](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/easyrequest_hay_project/blob/master/easyrequest_hay_app/lib/cleaner.py#L52-L66)
    - replace existing user info with cleaned info

- todos:
    - lightweight team/process/guidelines to determine default 'ok'/'possible' demographic data that implementation team can use as starting point?
    - run demographic data by planning team

### trigger webhook testing?

- re 2018-July-19 email from github re an outage...

        git commit --allow-empty -m "Empty commit to trigger post_receive hooks"

### most productive README

- [the readme](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/bell/blob/master/README.md)

- notes
    - each step shows the [task](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/bell/tree/master/tasks) and resulting [data-file](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/bell/tree/master/data)
    - some of the data-files serve as 'trackers', so the task can be re-run without unnecessary extra work being performed.
    - the final data-file is the data that CIS needs
        - provides easy "hot-update" capability

### filtering django queries...

Issue...

For ages, when I wanted to use django's way of querying for objects -- on multiple conditions -- I'd write something like:

        items = Item.objects.filter( field_a='abc' ).filter( field_b='def' )

...which, as I understand, gets translated into sql that says: get all the objects where field_a is 'abc' AND field_b is 'def'.

I recently began seeing a different syntax:

        items = Item.objects.filter( field_a='abc', field_b='def' )

...and assumed this was a new convenience syntax.

It mostly is, but there can be subtle differences in certain cases. Good to know. More info: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8164675/chaining-multiple-filter-in-django-is-this-a-bug>

### filename from a path...

This old dog _loves_ new tricks.

I've needed to parse the filename from a path more times than I can remember, and have done that different ways. But I just came across by far the easiest way (not sure how I could have missed this), using [os.path.basename()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.basename):

        >>> import os
        >>> file_path = '/path/to/file_name.txt'
        >>> os.path.basename( file_path )
        'file_name.txt'

...and fyi...

        >>> os.path.dirname( file_path )
        '/path/to'

### localdev email-testing...

- issue: you want to test email-sending locally, but don't want to install a sendmail/postfix server.

- solution:
    - set your application's email settings to use something like

            HOST: localhost
            PORT: 1026

    - open a terminal window, and enter

            python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1026

    - at this point, run your app, and when it sends an email, you'll see, in that terminal window, the output of what would have been sent, eg...
