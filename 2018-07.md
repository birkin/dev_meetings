### filename from a path...

This old dog _loves_ new tricks.

I've needed to parse the filename from a path more times than I can remember, and have done that different ways. But I just came across by far the easiest way (not sure how I could have missed this), using [os.path.basename()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.basename):

        >>> import os
        >>> file_path = '/path/to/file_name.txt'
        >>> os.path.basename( file_path )
        'file_name.txt'

...and fyi...

        >>> os.path.dirname( file_path )
        '/path/to'

### localdev email-testing...

- issue: you want to test email-sending locally, but don't want to install a sendmail/postfix server.

- solution:
    - set your application's email settings to use something like

            HOST: localhost
            PORT: 1026

    - open a terminal window, and enter

            python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1026

    - at this point, run your app, and when it sends an email, you'll see, in that terminal window, the output of what would have been sent, eg...
