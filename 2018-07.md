    - replace existing user info with cleaned info

- todos:
    - lightweight team/process/guidelines to determine default 'ok'/'possible' demographic data that implementation team can use as starting point?

### most productive README

- [the readme](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/bell/blob/master/README.md)

- notes
    - each step shows the [task](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/bell/tree/master/tasks) and resulting [data-file](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/bell/tree/master/data)
    - some of the data-files serve as 'trackers', so the task can be re-run without unnecessary extra work being performed.
    - the final data-file is the data that CIS needs
        - provides easy "hot-update" capability

### filtering django queries...

Issue...

For ages, when I wanted to use django's way of querying for objects -- on multiple conditions -- I'd write something like:

        items = Item.objects.filter( field_a='abc' ).filter( field_b='def' )

...which, as I understand, gets translated into sql that says: get all the objects where field_a is 'abc' AND field_b is 'def'.

I recently began seeing a different syntax:

        items = Item.objects.filter( field_a='abc', field_b='def' )

...and assumed this was a new convenience syntax.

It mostly is, but there can be subtle differences in certain cases. Good to know. More info: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8164675/chaining-multiple-filter-in-django-is-this-a-bug>

### filename from a path...

This old dog _loves_ new tricks.

I've needed to parse the filename from a path more times than I can remember, and have done that different ways. But I just came across by far the easiest way (not sure how I could have missed this), using [os.path.basename()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.basename):

        >>> import os
        >>> file_path = '/path/to/file_name.txt'
        >>> os.path.basename( file_path )
        'file_name.txt'

...and fyi...

        >>> os.path.dirname( file_path )
        '/path/to'

### localdev email-testing...

- issue: you want to test email-sending locally, but don't want to install a sendmail/postfix server.

- solution:
    - set your application's email settings to use something like

            HOST: localhost
            PORT: 1026

    - open a terminal window, and enter

            python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1026

    - at this point, run your app, and when it sends an email, you'll see, in that terminal window, the output of what would have been sent, eg...
