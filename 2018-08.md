### runserver vs apache-server

##### Issue...

Difference in handling encoding of non-ascii characters in a url.

- localhost runserver...

    - url... `<a href="καὶ_.html">καὶ</a>`

    - request.META['PATH_INFO']: '/proxy/grc/καὶ_.html/'

    - log showing passed urls.py regex capture: [06/Aug/2018 14:57:02] DEBUG [views-proxy()::33] slug, `grc/καὶ_.html`

- dev-server...

    - url... `<a href="καὶ_.html">καὶ</a>`

    - request.META['PATH_INFO']: '/proxy/grc/%25ce%25ba%25ce%25b1%25e1%25bd%25b6_.html/'

    - log showing passed urls.py regex capture: [06/Aug/2018 14:34:28] DEBUG [views-proxy()::33] slug, `grc/%25ce%25ba%25ce%25b1%25e1%25bd%25b6_.html`

##### Solution...

Force an unquote...

    >>>
    >>> import urllib.parse
    >>>
    >>> s = '%ce%ba%ce%b1%e1%bd%b6_.html'
    >>>
    >>> urllib.parse.unquote_plus( s )
    'καὶ_.html'
    >>>
    >>> s2 = 'καὶ_.html'
    >>>
    >>> urllib.parse.unquote_plus( s2 )
    'καὶ_.html'
    >>>
    >>> x = urllib.parse.unquote_plus( s2 )
    >>>
    >>> x == s2
    True
    >>>

### lazy troubleshooting

##### Issue...

An old project had stopped working due to a server migration. I recently got it working again, and then decided to upgrade the project's version of django.

It was a big jump and I addressed the usual such issues. But one stumped me for a while. In retrospect, I can now see that had I paid more attention to the traceback, I could have zeroed in on the location of the problem more quickly. But the traceback contained solely django & python error entries -- rather than indicators of where in _my_ code the problem lay -- so I dove into the view function in question and added logging. And added more logging. And more.

The surprising issue was that the view was returning a _good_ response -- yet the error persisted.

##### Solution...

By forcing a `return HttpResponse( 'foo' )` at various places in the code, I narrowed the possibilities. It turned out that the code was updating the session, and one element of the updated session was a datetime object. That object is not serializable in the current version of django, but was in the earlier version. The tricky part was that the session-update was only processed by the django middleware _after_ the response had been returned.

My take-aways...
- Treat library-only tracebacks more like a grownup.
- Be aware of how what I 'know' can get in the way of troubleshooting.
- Be aware of (not necessarily 'wary of') [lazy evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation). Django does this in a few places, most notably in it's [database-query code](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/db/queries/#querysets-are-lazy). And perhaps this example -- where the set-session code created an object acted on later -- isn't exactly an issue of lazy-evaluation. But it's conceptually similar, and my discernment was slowed by the non-procedural timing of the blow-up.
    - Interesting aside, from a 2009 [blog post](http://blog.brendel.com/2009/06/pitfalls-of-lazy-validation-in-djangos.html) on 'the pitfalls of lazy validation'...

        "It is not uncommon to retrieve a set of results via a query set and then perform some operations on them, for example in a loop. It is tempting to view query sets just as if they were arrays - lists of in-memory objects - and use them in a similar manner. In-memory arrays tend to be quite efficient, query sets not so much: If you have to run over such a loop several times, you will end up retrieving the same object from the database multiple times as well."

            my_set = MyModel.objects.all() # No database access
            print my_set[0]                # DB access and model instantiation...
            print my_set[0]                # ... and the same again!

        "If you need to iterate over the result set more than once - or just access the same element a few times - it is therefore more efficient to make copies of your individual results. That way, the query and the creation of model instance objects is done only once."

            my_set = [ m for m in MyModel.objects.all() ] # DB accessed for all
            print my_set[0]                               # No DB access!

##### Aside...

One of the tracebacks showed the failure occuring on the attempt by django to serialize the datetime object, and I could see from the code-snippet in the traceback that a JSONSerializer class was attempting to encode to 'latin-1'. The encoding had nothing to do with the error but threw me for a loop (as a passionate unicode/utf-8 evangelist). But it's not the main `json.dumps` serializer -- it's one specifically for url-safe actions. The [class](https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/core/signing.py#L81-L90); the [explanation](https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/core/signing.py#L2-L7).
