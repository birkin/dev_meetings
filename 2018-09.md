### api usage

- Issue...
    - we have systems in place to track end-user services:
        - how many books are checked out?
        - how many users use this or that electronic resource or webapp?
        - etc

        ...but many of our end-user services utilize APIs that we've built -- and we generally do not track their usage, making reasonable questions difficult to answer without a significant chunk of work:
            - what services use this API?
            - how often is it hit?
            - what's the breakdown of the kinds of hits?

- One solution...
    - I built a [stats-usage url](https://library.brown.edu/availability_api/v1_stats/?start_date=2018-09-01&end_date=2018-09-30) into the new availability-api
    - this api is used by easyAccess for resolving book requests. Example of it's [normal output](https://library.brown.edu/availability_api/v1/isbn/0688002307/).
    - the stats-api shows intended service usage, any other usage (usually for testing, or by users clicking links such as the example-link above)

- Implementation...

    My goal was some sort of lightweight solution to tracking usage. I didn't want every hit of the api to generate a database-update, and I didn't want every stats query to generate a lot of background processing.

    So I settled on using python's built-in logging functionality. It's fast, it's buit to minimize resource-usage, and all my logs are auto-rotated. Python/dango makes it easy to log to different log filesc so I set up one log specifically to store basic information about the query, in json format. Here's an example:

        {"datetime": "2018-09-11T13:40:23.992216", "query": "http://127.0.0.1/v1/isbn/9780521593700/", "referrer": null, "user_agent": "some-easyBorrow-useragent-identified", "ip": "127.0.0.1"}

    Then, once a day, a cron-job executes a script which:

    - reads a stored file containing the date-time-stamp of the last log entry that was read
    - scans the log file for new entries
    - and for each new entry updates or creates a database record of counts
    - each database record simply has a date, and a few count fields that are updated

    This way, when a stats-usage date-range is requested, a single database-query grabs the correct subset, and the subset counts are simply totaled.

### easyA fix

- Issue...
    - user arrived at a bib-page: ![josiah-bib-page](img_2018-08_a_josiah_to_ezb.png "josiah-bib-page")
    - since the item was 'missing', a helpful easyBorrow link appeared
    - clicking the easyBorrow link landed the user at a page with a few problems: ![ezb-page](img_2018-08_b_ezb.png "ezb-page")
        - no 'Request' button appeared, because there _was_ an available copy, teasingly previewed to the user
        - but the 'View more details' link returned the user to the page that shows the missing copy! A circular maddening vortex.
    - the reason..
        - the old availability-api ([sample](./old_availability_api_result.json)) that easyAccess called assumed an isbn would have a single bib; in this case [b2767927](https://search.library.brown.edu/catalog/b2767927). (This is true for the majority of times.)
        - the availability-api holdings for that isbn shows an 'available' copy -- so the easyBorrow request button doesn't appear
        - however, the old availability-api doesn't realize that the available copy is for a different bib, [b1815113](https://search.library.brown.edu/catalog/b1815113), hence the problem

- Solution...
    - the [new availability-api](https://library.brown.edu/availability_api/v1/isbn/0688002307/) clearly shows what holdings go with what bib, so easyAccess can return the user to the available copy
