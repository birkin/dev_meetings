### easyA fix

- Issue...
    - user arrived at a bib-page: ![josiah-bib-page](img_2018-08_a_josiah_to_ezb.png "josiah-bib-page")
    - since the item was 'missing', a helpful easyBorrow link appeared
    - clicking the easyBorrow link landed the user at a page with a few problems: ![ezb-page](img_2018-08_b_ezb.png "ezb-page")
        - no 'Request' button appeared, because there _was_ an available copy, teasingly previewed to the user
        - but the 'View more details' link returned the user to the page that shows the missing copy! A circular maddening vortex.
    - the reason..
        - the old availability-api ([sample](./old_availability_api_result.json)) that easyAccess called assumed an isbn would have a single bib; in this case [b2767927](https://search.library.brown.edu/catalog/b2767927). (This is true for the majority of times.)
        - the availability-api holdings for that isbn shows an 'available' copy -- so the easyBorrow request button doesn't appear
        - however, the old availability-api doesn't realize that the available copy is for a different bib, [b1815113](https://search.library.brown.edu/catalog/b1815113), hence the problem

- Solution...
    - the [new availability-api](https://library.brown.edu/availability_api/v1/isbn/0688002307/) clearly shows what holdings go with what bib, so easyAccess can return the user to the available copy
