### annex-hay requesting teamwork fix

- Issue...

    Annex-Hay easy-requesting was failing on a [Josiah bib](https://search.library.brown.edu/catalog/b3647974).

- Teamwork fix...

    I investigated; the hash symbol in the item-callnumber -- `Ms. Bianchi Box 1 (Inventory # 1 - 14)` -- was truncating the information that the easyrequest-hay service was able to process. Hector dove in and fixed.

### added online holdings

- Issue...

    easyAccess for books (easyBorrow) was showing alternate e-resources that link360 knew about, but _not_ alternate e-resources returned from the availability-api. (The reference [Josiah bib](https://search.library.brown.edu/catalog/b5707094).)

    - [availability-api results](https://library.brown.edu/availability_api/v1/isbn/9781587299803/) (see response->basics->online_holdings)
    - easyBorrow screenshot showing that the josiah e-resource info was _not_ displayed: ![ezb_before](img_2019-09_eza_screenshot_before.png "before-screenshot")

- Fix...

    - I turned the online info dict from link360 into a list, and appended any online holdings from the availability-api
    - easyBorrow screenshot showing that the josiah e-resource info _is_ now displayed: ![ezb_after](img_2019-09_eza_screenshot_after.png "after-screenshot")
