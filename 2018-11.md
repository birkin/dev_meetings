=========================


### easyA landing page make-over

 Old page had weird css artifacts, and accessability issues: ![old-easyAccess-info-page](mov_2018-10-19_ezb_landing_page.mov "old-easyAccess-info-page")

<!-- test: ![old-easyAccess-info-page](mov_2018-10-19_ezb_landing_page.mov "old-easyAccess-info-page") -->

New page doesn't.

### easyA Hay info

Say a patron is at worldcat and [finds an item](http://www.worldcat.org/title/zen-poems/oclc/49584180) she wants.

If she's on-campus or VPNed, and clicks the "Request this item" link, she'll land at [this 'easyBorrow' page](https://library.brown.edu/easyaccess/find/permalink/DSQM/).

Previously, the Hay information wasn't shown; now it is.
