### easyA Hay info

Say a patron is at worldcat and [finds an item](http://www.worldcat.org/title/zen-poems/oclc/49584180) she wants.

If she's on-campus or VPNed, and clicks the "Request this item" link, she'll land at [this 'easyBorrow' page](https://library.brown.edu/easyaccess/find/permalink/DSQM/).

Previously, the Hay information wasn't shown; now it is.

### easyA info page make-over

The [old info/example easyAccess page](./2018_media/mov_2018-10-19_ezb_landing_page.mov) had weird css artifacts, and '[wave](https://wave.webaim.org)' accessability issues:

The [new info/example page](https://library.brown.edu/easyaccess/find/), now using the '[Discovery](https://search.library.brown.edu/catalog/?f%5Bformat%5D%5B%5D=Book)' template that I love -- and have slowly applied to my projects -- has neither the css-artifacts nor the accessibility issues, while offering this template's standardization and app-specific customization.

---


### extending the above template to articles

The old article landing-pages weren't very attractive, and all had three `wave` accessibility _errors_ and four accessibility _alerts_. The new pages, based on the 'Discovery' template, are more attractive, but also are more consistent -- in that the user's citation is _always_ at the top, followed by availability-info.

See the [new info/example page](https://library.brown.edu/easyaccess/find/) for article examples. A couple, though:

- [print and online holdings; online link not direct to article](https://library.brown.edu/easyaccess/find/?volume=9&genre=article&spage=39&sid=EBSCO:qrh&title=Gay+%26+Lesbian+Review+Worldwide&date=20020501&issue=3&issn=15321118&pid=&atitle=Chaste+Take+on+Those+Naughty+Victorians)
    - previously this had an asterisk next to the online-link, _then_ the library-availability, _then_ info that the online-link isn't direct

- [print and online holdings; print link is for annex item](https://library.brown.edu/easyaccess/find/?pmid=11234459)
    - soon: given the new Blacklight callnumber search ability -- this link will be able to go to new-Josiah.
