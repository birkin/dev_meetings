### lightweight auto-update

Issue...

I went to update one of my entries in the [code-quality-check](https://library.brown.edu/good_code/info/) site, and after documenting an _improvement_, saw, on the save, my project's score _drop_.

Turns out that's because of a change I made, long ago. I _initially_ calculated the score on-the-fly on every page/image-access, but switched to storing the score in the database to save the overhead of the calculation. The score gets calculated on every save of the project-tracker object. The _problem_ with that is that some checks are time-based: If a check hasn't been done for six months, it needs to be re-checked. So what was happening was that some of my checks had expired -- but the score would not be updated until the object was again saved -- until my edit.

So, how to 'best' trigger the update, so scores are reasonably current?

[My solution](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/bul_cbp_project/blob/1bd65ef629e404d4021466099d6fecff359518b7/bul_cbp_app/lib/view_helper.py#L55), for now...

Whenever the overview page is loaded, find the most recent project-tracker object modification-date -- and if more than a day has passed by, re-save each of the objects, which will update their score and modification-date. (Arguably a re-save without a data change should not re-set the modification date, but this is working.) Since [our site-checker](https://library.brown.edu/sitechecker/status/) periodically checks the good-code site, it's likely that it, rather than a user, will trigger the daily re-save, so user accesses of overview or project-pages, or badges, should show an accurate score/image.

One thing I like about this solution is that the update-trigger mechanism doesn't require an 'extra' external process, like a cron-job (let's ignore the fact that the site-checker is cron-triggered!). This could be further improved by adding a bit of caching code so that the 'needs-update?' code is cached -- only when the answer is no -- saving a database lookup.

Feedback welcome.

2018-Nov-08 - sprint demo
=========================

### easyA Hay info

Say a patron is at worldcat and [finds an item](http://www.worldcat.org/title/zen-poems/oclc/49584180) she wants.

If she's on-campus or VPNed, and clicks the "Request this item" link, she'll land at [this 'easyBorrow' page](https://library.brown.edu/easyaccess/find/permalink/DSQM/).

Previously, the Hay information wasn't shown; now it is.

### easyA info page make-over

The [old info/example easyAccess page](./2018_media/mov_2018-10-19_ezb_landing_page.mov) had weird css artifacts, and '[wave](https://wave.webaim.org)' accessability issues:

The [new info/example page](https://library.brown.edu/easyaccess/find/), now using the '[Discovery](https://search.library.brown.edu/catalog/?f%5Bformat%5D%5B%5D=Book)' template that I love -- and have slowly applied to my projects -- has neither the css-artifacts nor the accessibility issues, while offering this template's standardization and app-specific customization.

---


### extending the above template to articles

The old article landing-pages weren't very attractive, and all had three `wave` accessibility _errors_ and four accessibility _alerts_. The new pages, based on the 'Discovery' template, are more attractive, but also are more consistent -- in that the user's citation is _always_ at the top, followed by availability-info.

See the [new info/example page](https://library.brown.edu/easyaccess/find/) for article examples. A couple, though:

- [print and online holdings; online link not direct to article](https://library.brown.edu/easyaccess/find/?volume=9&genre=article&spage=39&sid=EBSCO:qrh&title=Gay+%26+Lesbian+Review+Worldwide&date=20020501&issue=3&issn=15321118&pid=&atitle=Chaste+Take+on+Those+Naughty+Victorians)
    - previously this had an asterisk next to the online-link, _then_ the library-availability, _then_ info that the online-link isn't direct

- [print and online holdings; print link is for annex item](https://library.brown.edu/easyaccess/find/?pmid=11234459)
    - soon: given the new Blacklight callnumber search ability -- this link will be able to go to new-Josiah.
