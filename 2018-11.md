### easyA info page make-over

The [old info/example easyAccess page](./2018_media/mov_2018-10-19_ezb_landing_page.mov) had weird css artifacts, and '[wave](https://wave.webaim.org)' accessability issues:

The [new info/example page](https://library.brown.edu/easyaccess/find/), now using the '[Discovery](https://search.library.brown.edu/catalog/?f%5Bformat%5D%5B%5D=Book)' template that I love -- and have slowly applied to my projects -- has neither the css-artifacts nor the accessibility issues, while offering this template's standardization and app-specific customization.


### extending the above template to articles

The old article landing-pages weren't very attractive, and all had three `wave` accessibility _errors_ and four accessibility _alerts_. The new pages, based on the 'Discovery' template, are more attractive, but also are more consistent -- in that the user's citation is _always_ at the top, followed by availability-info.

See the [new info/example page](https://library.brown.edu/easyaccess/find/) for article examples.

### easyA Hay info

Say a patron is at worldcat and [finds an item](http://www.worldcat.org/title/zen-poems/oclc/49584180) she wants.

If she's on-campus or VPNed, and clicks the "Request this item" link, she'll land at [this 'easyBorrow' page](https://library.brown.edu/easyaccess/find/permalink/DSQM/).

Previously, the Hay information wasn't shown; now it is.
