### question: best-practices for api documentation?

- issue...
    - I was preparing an example usage of an api for H.C., and the url I was going to send to him threw a 500 error. Looking into it, I saw that a required parameter was not present.
    - I can, of course, in code -- require that certain parameters are present (and that certain parameters are permited) -- the question: how to use that code so that it could be fed into some sort of api documentation or api help-response?
        - example: if the required/permitted fields were in the form of a json string, that same string could be used both for internal validation -- and for a documentation/help response.

### shortlink experimentation

- issue: Some code and packages I've seen apply a function to the database-id. This has always felt brittle, and in fact, caused issues in a db migration for the easyAccess project a while back. I was curious about an alternative, and explored using epoch-microseconds.

### controller flow

- Two flow possibilities occurred to me for an additional BorrowDirect lookup; which should I have chosen?

    - specify the main BorrowDirect flow, and handle the two implementations within that. That's the [curent implementation](https://github.com/birkin/easyborrow_controller/blob/call_new_bd_api/EzBorrowController.py#L117) I chose.


    - alternate thought: add the alternate flow to an additional [flow-list](https://github.com/birkin/easyborrow_controller/blob/call_new_bd_api/EzBorrowController.py#L307-L326) entry.
