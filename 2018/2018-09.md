### xisbn exploration

- Issue...

    - If a user requests isbn X, and we don't have it available, __and__ if we have an alternate edition available in the same language and format, we should show that alternate addition (while still allowing the user to request the initial isbn).

    - We used to do this. Years ago, I built an internal webservice that queried OCLC's xisbn-api on an isbn, got alternates, looped through the alternates hitting an OCLC metadata-api on the original and alternate isbns to filter the alternates on language and format -- and then sent the filtered alternates to an availability-api I'd created to further filter on items we had that were available. Those were then displayed on the easyAccess/Borrow landing page.

    - This worked, __live__, for one main reason, as I recall. The list of alternates returned by OCLC were in order of... 'popularity' -- so to keep response-times reasonable, I just checked the first few alternates on language and format, and then on our availability.

- Exploration...

    - I found [isbnlib](https://isbnlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and sought to reenable the previous xisbn service.

    - Results

        - It doesn't appear I can do this live and reliably, for two reasons.

            - First, I can't reliably get metadata on the original isbn (let alone many of the alternate isbns). That's needed to at least filter the alternates on language (and, ideally, format).
            - Second, I haven't discerned a pattern to the order of returned alternates -- but it's clear that it's not by 'popularity', which is necessary to heighten the chances of just a few alternate checks return something useful.

        - I experimented with a script that does the necessary filterings (a: alternates; b: filtered on language and format; c: filtered on our holdings). I did get that to work, and began thinking about that service _might_ be implemented off-line in the future.
            - This is a fascinating issue...
                - What isbns should the script start processing?
                - Should there perhaps be different workers processing different stages of filtering?

        - Default isbn metadata service used by isbnlib (I think):
            - <https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=isbn:9780099598169&fields=items/volumeInfo(title,authors,publisher,publishedDate,language,industryIdentifiers)&maxResults=1>
            - Note that this doesn't return 'format'. But I found out [how to do that](https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=isbn:9780099598169&fields=items/volumeInfo(title,printType,authors,publisher,publishedDate,language,industryIdentifiers)&maxResults=1), by adding `printType` to specification.

### online availability #3

- We currently get online availability ([example](https://library.brown.edu/easyaccess/find/permalink/W9X/)) on the easyAccess/Borrow landing page from two sources: the link360-api and the internal availability-api (which hits z39.50).

- Just found another one, thanks to an investigation by H.C. and J.N., implemented by T.L.
    - This [classic-josiah record](http://josiah.brown.edu/record=b3754844) shows an available Hathi Trust record. How?
        - It's calling a [javascript file](http://josiah.brown.edu/screens/josiah_helpers.js) that contains a `function hathi(oclc) {}` which checks the hathi holdings via a url like this:
        - <https://catalog.hathitrust.org/api/volumes/brief/oclc/ocm24648004.json>

- import: this is cool... and should be added to the easyAccess/Borrow landing-page background check.

### api usage

- Issue...
    - we have systems in place to track end-user services:
        - how many books are checked out?
        - how many users use this or that electronic resource or webapp?
        - etc

        ...but many of our end-user services utilize APIs that we've built -- and we generally do not track their usage, making reasonable questions difficult to answer without a significant chunk of work:
            - what services use this API?
            - how often is it hit?
            - what's the breakdown of the kinds of hits?

- One solution...
    - I built a [stats-usage url](https://library.brown.edu/availability_api/v1_stats/?start_date=2018-09-01&end_date=2018-09-30) into the new availability-api
    - this api is used by easyAccess for resolving book requests. Example of it's [normal output](https://library.brown.edu/availability_api/v1/isbn/0688002307/).
    - the stats-api shows intended service usage, any other usage (usually for testing, or by users clicking links such as the example-link above)

- Implementation...

    My goal was some sort of lightweight solution to tracking usage. I didn't want every hit of the api to generate a database-update, and I didn't want every stats query to generate a lot of background processing.

    So I settled on using python's built-in logging functionality. It's fast, it's buit to minimize resource-usage, and all my logs are auto-rotated. Python/dango makes it easy to log to different log filesc so I set up one log specifically to store basic information about the query, in json format. Here's an example:

        {"datetime": "2018-09-11T13:40:23.992216", "query": "http://127.0.0.1/v1/isbn/9780521593700/", "referrer": null, "user_agent": "some-easyBorrow-useragent-identified", "ip": "127.0.0.1"}

    Then, once a day, a cron-job executes a script which:

    - reads a stored file containing the date-time-stamp of the last log entry that was read
    - scans the log file for new entries
    - and for each new entry updates or creates a database record of counts
    - each database record simply has a date, and a few count fields that are updated

    This way, when a stats-usage date-range is requested, a single database-query grabs the correct subset, and the subset counts are simply totaled.

### easyA fix

- Issue...
    - user arrived at a bib-page: ![josiah-bib-page](img_2018-08_a_josiah_to_ezb.png "josiah-bib-page")
    - since the item was 'missing', a helpful easyBorrow link appeared
    - clicking the easyBorrow link landed the user at a page with a few problems: ![ezb-page](img_2018-08_b_ezb.png "ezb-page")
        - no 'Request' button appeared, because there _was_ an available copy, teasingly previewed to the user
        - but the 'View more details' link returned the user to the page that shows the missing copy! A circular maddening vortex.
    - the reason..
        - the old availability-api ([sample](./old_availability_api_result.json)) that easyAccess called assumed an isbn would have a single bib; in this case [b2767927](https://search.library.brown.edu/catalog/b2767927). (This is true for the majority of times.)
        - the availability-api holdings for that isbn shows an 'available' copy -- so the easyBorrow request button doesn't appear
        - however, the old availability-api doesn't realize that the available copy is for a different bib, [b1815113](https://search.library.brown.edu/catalog/b1815113), hence the problem

- Solution...
    - the [new availability-api](https://library.brown.edu/availability_api/v1/isbn/0688002307/) clearly shows what holdings go with what bib, so easyAccess can return the user to the available copy
