### CETEIcean

- used to display information for the IIP project ([main](https://library.brown.edu/cds/projects/iip/viewinscr/abur0001/) / [dev](https://library.brown.edu/iip_development/viewinscr/abur0001/))

- [thorough overview](http://teic.github.io/CETEIcean/Balisage-CETEIcean.html)

    - Excerpts...

        `The standard method for displaying a TEI document on the web is to either pre-transform it to HTML using XSLT or to dynamically transform it to HTML, again usually with XSLT or possibly XQuery.... ...CETEIcean... was developed to support a lightweight TEI presentation workflow that requires neither pre-display document transformation nor any complex server-side architecture. All that is needed to use it is a web server. The browser does all of the work. CETEIcean is an ECMAScript (JavaScript) library that reads in TEI XML and converts it to HTML Custom Elements. The converted source can then be rendered using standard CSS and JavaScript techniques. CETEIcean supplies a method, calld "behaviors" to add decorations—or even make widgets out of—TEI elements...`

        `CETEIcean converts all TEI elements to an “HTML” equivalent with a tei- prefix... ...For most elements, this is sufficient, but for TEI elements which have HTML equivalents, more work is necessary. TEI has a couple of constructs roughly equivalent to HTML <a href> for example, namely <ref target> and <ptr target/>... ...CETEIcean handles this...`

### ILLiad web api

- [documentation link](https://prometheus.atlas-sys.com/display/illiad/The+ILLiad+Web+Platform+API) found by J.M. (yay!):

- highlights... (search the page on these terms; they're not directly link-able)

    - easyAccess functionality
        - "Get user by username"
            - I don't see a way to determine `blocked` status, but will look more
        - "Create User"
        - "Create a transaction request"
        - I don't see a way to _update_ a user, but will look more

    - K.H. cool "[myStuff](https://library.brown.edu/libweb/mystuff/)" functionality
        - "Retrieving Requests for User"

### regular-expression coolness...

- Issue: long ago for the [IIP project](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/iip-texts), some folk were using Microsoft Word's xml-export function. The problem, as described to me, was that there was (is?) some sort of internal size-saving/efficiency mechanism that 'normalized' similar-appearing characters. The problem: many non-ascii characters were turned into their ascii look-alikes. Example -- the [Greek 'R'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho) characters were turned into the Latin 'P'.

- Solution: Elli was able to find and correct these characters by running the errant text through regular expressions, searching unicode ranges. Who knew [regular-expressions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3748855/how-do-i-specify-a-range-of-unicode-characters-in-a-regular-expression-in-python) could do this? (Besides K.H.!!!)
    - unicode technical standard -- [unicode regular expressions](http://unicode.org/reports/tr18/)
