### Jupyter notebooks

- demo-ed creation of a jupyter notebook locally.
- noted required imports in local virtual environment to be able to create/open the notebook.
- noted required import (in local virtual environment) to be able to run the external 'requests' package
- put demo notebook in github
    - noted github's ability to properly render the notebook -- but that it was not interactive
- put demo notebook on google drive, and accessed 'colab' app
    - noted lack of needing to install anything else
    - noted -- and tested live with B.C. the ability to share the notebook and have our edits appear live in each others' notebook
- resources...
    - The fascinating article that sparked my interest in jupyter notebooks as part of serious academic information-sharing: https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/
    - A jupyter notebook tutorial: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/
    - Some colab info: https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-google-colab-f2fff97f594c
    - JupyterHub -- a colab competitor: https://jupyter.org/hub
    - Github has built-in (non-interactive viewing), but if you see a notebook url elsewhere on the web, this site can make it viewable (non-interactive): https://nbviewer.jupyter.org
        - And note that the nbviewer site can hand-off to another site to make it interactive! (with patience): https://mybinder.org

### Waitlists for Libraries

Interested in a bit of brainstorming...

To charge my Bolt, I frequently use a feature of the [ChargePoint](https://www.chargepoint.com) app, the ['waitlist'](https://www.chargepoint.com/drivers/waitlist-faq/), which ChargePoint [introduced](https://www.chargepoint.com/about/news/electric-vehicle-drivers-enjoy-charging-first-come-first-served-basis-chargepoints-new/) in 2016. I only realized how _useful_ this was when Brown temporarily disabled it. The result during that period was that when a spot opened up, everyone who'd signed up for a 'Notification' got a text message, and a mad scramble ensued to see who could get to the open spot first. Not good. But the waitlist is back, so we EV drivers can again pretend we're a gentle bunch.

The software has some interesting features. I'll note a few later -- but my question for the brainstorming: What library services/resources might benefit from waitlist features?

- carrels
- resources like checked-out laptops?
- expensive resources like that chemistry web-app with very few license seats?

### TinyMCE & Gutenberg

I attended a WordPress-Campus webinar this week that focused on a push to [improve the accessibility](https://wpcampus.org/2019/01/gutenberg-audit-vendor/) of a new WordPress editing tool/environment, "Gutenberg".

I've only ever dabbled with WordPress. Though my admiration for it is great, my knowledge of that ecosystem is pretty sparse. I had thought Gutenberg was a replacement for the independent-project TinyMCE that WordPress was using. After googling a bit, I think a more accurate description is that Gutenberg is a React-based tool WordPress has developed to upgrade its editing environment.

Some info I found useful...

- A [5-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzxfBbkmDmM) of Gutenberg in action

- Some [new features](https://hookagency.com/tinymce-vs-gutenberg/) not previously available via TinyMCE

- A clarification from [tiny.cloud](https://www.tiny.cloud) that TinyMCE isn't going away, that, in fact, [Gutenberg in part _uses_ TinyMCE](https://go.tiny.cloud/blog/gutenberg-tinymce-faq/)
