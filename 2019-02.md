### Waitlists for Libraries

Interested in a bit of brainstorming...

To charge my Bolt, I frequently use a feature of the [ChargePoint](https://www.chargepoint.com) app, the ['waitlist'](https://www.chargepoint.com/drivers/waitlist-faq/), which ChargePoint [introduced](https://www.chargepoint.com/about/news/electric-vehicle-drivers-enjoy-charging-first-come-first-served-basis-chargepoints-new/) in 2016. I only realized how _useful_ this was when Brown temporarily disabled it. The result during that period was that when a spot opened up, everyone who'd signed up for a 'Notification' got a text message, and a mad scramble ensued to see who could get to the open spot first. Not good. But the waitlist is back, so we EV drivers can again pretend we're a gentle bunch.

The software has some interesting features. I'll note a few later -- but my question for the brainstorming: What library services/resources might benefit from waitlist features?

### TinyMCE & Gutenberg

I attended a WordPress-Campus webinar this week that focused on a push to [improve the accessibility](https://wpcampus.org/2019/01/gutenberg-audit-vendor/) of a new WordPress editing tool/environment, "Gutenberg".

I've only ever dabbled with WordPress. Though my admiration for it is great, my knowledge of that ecosystem is pretty sparse. I had thought Gutenberg was a replacement for the independent-project TinyMCE that WordPress was using. After googling a bit, I think a more accurate description is that Gutenberg is a React-based tool WordPress has developed to upgrade its editing environment.

Some info I found useful...

- A [5-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzxfBbkmDmM) of Gutenberg in action

- Some [new features](https://hookagency.com/tinymce-vs-gutenberg/) not previously available via TinyMCE

- A clarification from [tiny.cloud](https://www.tiny.cloud) that TinyMCE isn't going away, that, in fact, [Gutenberg in part _uses_ TinyMCE](https://go.tiny.cloud/blog/gutenberg-tinymce-faq/)
