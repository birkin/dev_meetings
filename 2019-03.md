### Web AR

- easy way to try (the "2 easy steps" section at the top): <https://github.com/jeromeetienne/ar.js>

    - for my iphone, I had to, in Settings -> Safari:
        - disable "Block Pop-ups"
        - enable "Camera & Microphone Access"

    - my question... what are some brainstorm ideas of how some (good, secure, non-privacy-violating) version of this might be useful in our realm?
