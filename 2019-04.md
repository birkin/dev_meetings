        Hello everyone,

        I'm working on a proof of concept web application for common library data
        conversions with support for large files.
        The application is build using a serverless architecture, which allows me
        do this at scale and at low cost.

        Online Bibliographic Metadata Tools
        https://tools4lib.com

        I currently have working conversions with large file support for MARC, XML,
        JSON, RDF and JSON-LD.
        There are of course many great open source tools for converting bib
        formats. My goal is to make these file conversions convenient and easy,
        without the need to download software or any programming knowledge.
        Please try it out and let me know what you think. What common data
        conversions do you do?
        If there is enough interest, I will continue to develop more features.

        Thanks.
        Thomas


- [sample small marc-file](./2019_media/sample_small_marc_file.mrc) to try out.

### NSF awards api

<https://www.research.gov/common/webapi/awardapisearch-v1.htm>

Scrolling down a bit shows some sample queries, like:

- <http://api.nsf.gov/services/v1/awards.json?keyword=water>

...but the real play is in trying out some of the other 'Request Parameters', like...

- getting the next 25

    <http://api.nsf.gov/services/v1/awards.json?keyword=water?offset=25>

    (yes, I'm repeating the last element to show the linkage)

- customizing the output

    <https://api.nsf.gov/services/v1/awards.json?keyword=water&printFields=id,title,fundsObligatedAmt,abstractText>
