### NSF awards api

<https://www.research.gov/common/webapi/awardapisearch-v1.htm>

Scrolling down a bit shows some sample queries, like:

- <http://api.nsf.gov/services/v1/awards.json?keyword=water>

...but the real play is in trying out some of the other 'Request Parameters', like...

- getting the next 25

    <http://api.nsf.gov/services/v1/awards.json?keyword=water?offset=25>

    (yes, I'm repeating the last element to show the linkage)

- customizing the output

    <https://api.nsf.gov/services/v1/awards.json?keyword=water&printFields=id,title,fundsObligatedAmt,abstractText>
