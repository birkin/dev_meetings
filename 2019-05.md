### Subresource Integrity

- It all began with discovering an [old yellow-fade demo](https://library.brown.edu/bjd/yf.html), thanks to J.M. clean-up requests.

- Looking at the source, it was referencing a localhost load of jquery, so I thought I'd load up jquery from a CDN, which led me to this [jquery CDN page](https://code.jquery.com), which showed this loader-line:

        <script   src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.4.min.js"   integrity="sha256-ZosEbRLbNQzLpnKIkEdrPv7lOy9C27hHQ+Xp8a4MxAQ="   crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

    - An _"inegrity"_ attribute? That's intriguing.

- Many resources, here's a 2015 [mozilla explanation](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/09/subresource-integrity-in-firefox-43/)
    - The hash pretty much does what you'd expect: act as a verification.

- A question...
    - [Can-I-Use](https://caniuse.com/#feat=subresource-integrity) indicates that the big three modern browsers support this. BUT...
        - Firefox -- seemingly appropriately -- won't run that jquery-based javascript.
        - Chrome acknowledges not being able to confirm the integrity, but runs it.
        - Safari (Mac) runs it, not even acknowledging there might be an issue.
    - Why these differences?
