### Call function via string

- Issue: I was calling a module passing in a string argument that was the name of a function I wanted to call. Example call:

    `$ python3 ./code/misc.py --function build_keys`)

    Initially I used [explicit if/elif statements](https://github.com/birkin/book_work_project/blob/9ca7587e82f17a3b1b9d182c8edee0892c603aeb/code/misc.py#L90-L99), but knew there must be a way of using those strings directly.

- Solution: StackOverflow shows a few ways; [here's the implementation I used](https://github.com/birkin/book_work_project/blob/9ca7587e82f17a3b1b9d182c8edee0892c603aeb/code/misc.py#L70-L80). It's simple, and the dict ensures safety.

2019-May-23 - sprint recap
==========================

main work this sprint...

- sprint...
    - met with and made plan with hay folk for work next sprint
    - implemented better source-link into illiad
    - showed bart a demo of the annex accessions&refiles api he requested -- [dev-demo](https://dlibwwwcit.services.brown.edu/annex_counts/stats/?start_date=2019-01-01&end_date=2019-01-31) (counts are random) Example output:

            {
              "request": {
                "timestamp": "2019-05-23 14:03:09.529094",
                "url": "https://dlibwwwcit.services.brown.edu/annex_counts/stats/?start_date=2019-01-01&end_date=2019-01-31"
              },
              "response": {
                "count_detail": {
                  "Hay_Accessions": 6421,
                  "Hay_Refiles": 9878,
                  "Non-Hay_Accessions": 3472,
                  "Non-Hay_Refiles": 7488
                },
                "count_total": 27259,
                "elapsed_time": "0:00:00.000832",
                "period_begin_timestamp": "2019-01-01 00:00:00",
                "period_end_timestamp": "2019-01-31 23:59:59"
              }
            }

    - got ts-reports script working again -- incorporated a modified cool script by H.C. to automate an exported marc records combine-step useful for different projects
    - started [plain-language summary](https://github.com/birkin/ts_reporting_project/blob/dev/README.md) of the ts-reports project
    - gained access to ebsco full-text-finder (linkIQ) for testing; created google-doc with info.
        - listed in google-doc, but, for reference, [swagger-interface](https://developer.ebsco.com/interactive/linkiq), and other [linkIQ documentation](https://developer.ebsco.com/reference/linkiqref)
        - example [linkIQ response](./2019_media/example_linkiq_output.json). I'll compare with [corresponding link360-api data from serials-solutions](https://library.brown.edu/easyaccess/find/link360/?sid=google&auinit=T&aulast=SOTA&atitle=Phylogeny+and+divergence+time+of+island+tiger+beetles+of+the+genus+Cylindera+(Coleoptera:+Cicindelidae)+in+East+Asia&id=doi:10.1111/j.1095-8312.2011.01617.x&title=Biological+journal+of+the+Linnean+Society&volume=102&issue=4&date=2011&spage=715&issn=0024-4066)
- other...
    - got new-titles working again after drupal take-down
    - fixed long-standing but rarely occurring callnumber-api bug and made some other improvements while there
    - fixed long-standing but rarely occuring easyrequest-hay bug and made some other improvements while there. (upgraded packages github said had vulnerabilities)
        - squashed another easyRequest_Hay-related bug w/H.C.
    - made easyAccess improvement to genre=bookitem links that were dumped into ILLiad unnecessarily. (while in easyAccess for sprint task)
    - worked with J.M. to properly handle us.epigraphy https javascript calls, via code & domain-certificate improvements
    - while working on the easyrequest-hay sprint project, i looked into improving sierra-requesting, and discovered capabilities the api offers that we don't have access to, and initiated work to get that access
        - [all api endpoints](https://sandbox.iii.com/iii/sierra-api/swagger/index.html) we could have access to
        - [our current api endpoints](https://catalog.library.brown.edu//iii/sierra-api/swagger/index.html)
        - odd but good, we had less data in early may:
            - [our early May endpoints](./2019_media/api_brown_endpoints.png)
            - [our early May patron-info options](./2019_media/api_brown_patron_options.png)
    - initial [open-book-experimentation](https://library.brown.edu/titles/) from issue S.E. & E.F. brought to H.C. & me

=========================

### Subresource Integrity

- It all began with discovering an [old yellow-fade demo](https://library.brown.edu/bjd/yf.html), thanks to J.M. clean-up requests.

- Looking at the source, it was referencing a localhost load of jquery, so I thought I'd load up jquery from a CDN, which led me to this [jquery CDN page](https://code.jquery.com), which showed this loader-line:

        <script   src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.4.min.js"   integrity="sha256-ZosEbRLbNQzLpnKIkEdrPv7lOy9C27hHQ+Xp8a4MxAQ="   crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

    - An _"inegrity"_ attribute? That's intriguing.

- Many resources, here's a 2015 [mozilla explanation](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/09/subresource-integrity-in-firefox-43/)
    - The hash pretty much does what you'd expect: act as a verification.

- A question...
    - [Can-I-Use](https://caniuse.com/#feat=subresource-integrity) indicates that the big three modern browsers support this. BUT...
        - Firefox -- seemingly appropriately -- won't run that jquery-based javascript.
        - Chrome acknowledges not being able to confirm the integrity, but runs it.
        - Safari (Mac) runs it, not even acknowledging there might be an issue.
    - Why these differences?

- I _think_ it's that `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute.
    - B.C. noted a [subresource-integrity chromium test-page](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/subresource-integrity/) that Chrome and Safari treat as expected. I note that these do not have that `crossorigin` attribute.
    - removing the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute from the yellow-fade demo page, OR, setting it to the other legit value `crossorigin="use-credentials"` -- successfully _prevents_ Chrome and Safari from running the javascript -- so the `anonymous` value seems to override the integrity check.
    - some [crossorigin-attribute info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/CORS_settings_attributes).
