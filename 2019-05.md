### Subresource Integrity

- It all began with discovering an [old yellow-fade demo](https://library.brown.edu/bjd/yf.html), thanks to J.M. clean-up requests.

- Looking at the source, it was referencing a localhost load of jquery, so I thought I'd load up jquery from a CDN, which led me to this [jquery CDN page](https://code.jquery.com), which showed this loader-line:

        <script   src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.4.min.js"   integrity="sha256-ZosEbRLbNQzLpnKIkEdrPv7lOy9C27hHQ+Xp8a4MxAQ="   crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

    - An _"inegrity"_ attribute? That's intriguing.

- Many resources, here's a 2015 [mozilla explanation](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/09/subresource-integrity-in-firefox-43/)
    - The hash pretty much does what you'd expect: act as a verification.

- A question...
    - [Can-I-Use](https://caniuse.com/#feat=subresource-integrity) indicates that the big three modern browsers support this. BUT...
        - Firefox -- seemingly appropriately -- won't run that jquery-based javascript.
        - Chrome acknowledges not being able to confirm the integrity, but runs it.
        - Safari (Mac) runs it, not even acknowledging there might be an issue.
    - Why these differences?

- I _think_ it's that `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute.
    - B.C. noted a [subresource-integrity chromium test-page](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/subresource-integrity/) that Chrome and Safari treat as expected. I note that these do not have that `crossorigin` attribute.
    - removing the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute from the yellow-fade demo page, OR, setting it to the other legit value `crossorigin="use-credentials"` -- successfully _prevents_ Chrome and Safari from running the javascript -- so the `anonymous` value seems to override the integrity check.
    - some [crossorigin-attribute info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/CORS_settings_attributes).
