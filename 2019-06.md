### Concurrent programming

Not ready for a good presentation, but some tidbits...

- best overview article on concurrent programming -- in python -- I've come across in a while: [link](https://realpython.com/python-concurrency/)
    - good overview of python's `threading` (pre-emptive multitasking), python's new `asyncio` (cooperative multitasking), and python's `multiprocessing`.

- I used [trio](https://github.com/python-trio/trio) for a [project](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/annex_receipts/blob/0fe4c0186b5f92b2edc12b9f153fa05ed536bf6c/past_files_poster.py#L161).
    - trio tag-line: "concurrency for mere mortals"
    - _terrific_ pycon 2018 presentation ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLkfnc_UMcE))

- interesting stuff that came up...
    - semaphore
        - [my code](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/annex_receipts/blob/0fe4c0186b5f92b2edc12b9f153fa05ed536bf6c/past_files_poster.py#L249)
        - great [source of trio concurrency info](<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51250706/combining-semaphore-and-time-limiting-in-python-trio-with-asks-http-request) about achieving a certain goal -- one way using a semaphore, another not
    - partial
        - I simply used this as a way to call a function with keywords when it didn't want keywords
        - [my code](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/annex_receipts/blob/0fe4c0186b5f92b2edc12b9f153fa05ed536bf6c/past_files_poster.py#L183) (enabled via `from functools import partial`)
        - _why_ I wanted to send kwargs: [code with positional arguments](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/annex_receipts/blob/0fe4c0186b5f92b2edc12b9f153fa05ed536bf6c/past_files_poster.py#L405) I was emulating
        - some explanations
            - from [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/partial-functions-python/) -- "Partial functions allow us to fix a certain number of arguments of a function and generate a new function."
            - from [here](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Partial_functions) -- "Partial functions allow one to derive a function with x parameters to a function with fewer parameters and fixed values set for the more limited function."
            - [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.partial) -- "Return a new [partial object](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#partial-objects) which when called will behave like func called with the positional arguments args and keyword arguments keywords."
