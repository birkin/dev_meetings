### Selenium work

- issue:
    - I needed to update the logic controlling the display of hay 'request-item' links. Meaning _whether_ a request-item link should appear, and _what type_ of link should appear. Also, there are multiple conditions that affect this: the item's format / location / status / callnumber / exclusion-list
    - So, how to make improvements without breaking existing working code?

- Since the links are built by javascript, I decide to use [selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io) for the functional tests.
    - it has libraries for multiple languages
    - there's a plug-in for Firefox that sort of gives you a graphical IDE

- [code-repo](https://github.com/birkin/blacklight_hay_FTcode)

- minor cool things:
    - '[implicitly wait](https://github.com/birkin/blacklight_hay_FTcode/blob/17ace6eb7bf35801e5a807d172dab8221675441b/lib/page_checks.py#L24)' -- the driver will auto-wait up to x-seconds for expected things to appear.
    - [head vs headless](https://github.com/birkin/blacklight_hay_FTcode/blob/17ace6eb7bf35801e5a807d172dab8221675441b/lib/page_checks.py#L16-L17) mode

- full-on dreaming...

    - set of tests for each type of the SIX links (easyBorrow, request-annex-item, request-annex-scan, request-hay-item, request-annex-hay-item, jcb-aeon)
    - allow constituents to run 'their' tests via web-call

### log tracebacks

- [python traceback module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html)

- log.exception( 'message' )

produces...

    [12/Jul/2019 10:32:44] ERROR [views-error_check()::47] exception; traceback...
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/opt/local/django_projects/easyaccess_stuff/easyaccess_project/status_app/views.py", line 45, in error_check

### remove item from array in javascript

- python

        >>> import this
        The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

        [snip]
        There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
        Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

- php has lots of ways to do different things.
