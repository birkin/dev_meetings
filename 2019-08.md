### secretly-in-public-domain books

Nice that one of my kids sent me [this article link](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kz4e3e/millions-of-books-are-secretly-in-the-public-domain-you-can-download-them-free).

Blurb: "_A quirk of copyright law means that millions of books are now free for anyone to read, thanks to some work from the New York Public Library._"

### chaos engineering

B.C. posted this [slack blog-post recently](https://slack.engineering/disasterpiece-theater-slacks-process-for-approachable-chaos-engineering-3434422afb54), which included the line:

_...This isn’t (yet) Chaos Engineering as practiced and evangelized by Netflix..._

...which of course sounded utterly fascinating, too.

Some references...

- a 2011 blog-post from netflix on their thinking: "[The Netflix Simian Army](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/the-netflix-simian-army-16e57fbab116)". A wonderful partial excerpt...

    _One way to make sure you can deal with a flat tire on the freeway, in the rain, in the middle of the night is to poke a hole in your tire ... ...and go through the drill of replacing it... ...This was our philosophy when we built Chaos Monkey, a tool that randomly disables our production instances to make sure we can survive this common type of failure without any customer impact. The name comes from the idea of unleashing a wild monkey with a weapon in your data center (or cloud region) to randomly shoot down instances and chew through cables..._

    - I can't find the link right now, but one of the chaos-toolkit projects references experimenting with the toolkit at <https://katacoda.com/chaostoolkit>

    - [katacoda](https://katacoda.com) seems kind of cool -- like a jupyter-notebook environment geared for folk [creating](https://katacoda.com/create) tutorials.

### a small bookmarklet thing...

- Issue, I'm testing the development version of a webapp that only accepts requests from new-josiah. I could right-click on the search.library.brown.edu link & 'inspect' the link and change it to our dev-server -- but this is easier: a [bookmarklet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet).

    - bookmark name: `update lib to dlib`

    - bookmark url:

            javascript:(function(){document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='https://path/to/the.js';})();

    - [example bib to demo](https://search.library.brown.edu/catalog/b5479552)

    - the js...

            anchors = document.getElementsByTagName("a");

            for (var i = 0; i < anchors.length; i++) {
                if ( anchors[i].href.includes("library.brown.edu/webapp_root") ) {
                    // alert( "i is..." + i );
                    s1 = anchors[i].href;
                    s2 = s1.replace("library.brown.edu/", "the_dev_server.brown.edu/");
                    anchors[i].href = s2;
                }
            }

2019-August-02 - dev-meeting
============================

### accessing google spreadsheets

- python3 style: [file_link](https://github.com/birkin/book_locator_project/blob/2593df456f498ae8eda65e3d5587f7055ec9049e/book_locator_app/lib/index.py)

- A main difference...

        # credentials = SignedJwtAssertionCredentials(json_key['client_email'], json_key['private_key'].encode(), scope)  # py2
        credentials = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name( settings_app.GSHEET_KEY_PATH, scope )  # py3

    I did try the email/private-key/scope params, and the docs indicated it should have worked, but it didn't -- and tutorials pointed to loading the whole json-key file.

- Issue...

    I was able to access the doc, see title and other info about the multile worksheets in the doc -- but could _not_ actually load and read data from an individual worksheet.

    Tried a few things from googling, and ended up reverting to an older version of [gspread](https://gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a python library for doing this sort of thing.

    Apparently, the newer versions of gspread use, behind-the-scenes, version 4 of google doc/sheet APIs (which are supposed to be faster). The older version of gspread uses version 3 of those APIs, and is deprecated. So... invitation for folk to gather in the future to try to get the newer version of gspread working!

### when sort() doesn't

- python2

        >>> lst = [ 1, 'a', 2 ]
        >>>
        >>> lst.sort()
        >>>
        >>> lst
        [1, 2, 'a']
        >>>
        >>> lst = [ 1, None, 2 ]
        >>>
        >>> lst.sort()
        >>>
        >>> lst
        [None, 1, 2]


- python3

        >>> lst = [ 1, 'a', 2 ]
        >>>
        >>> lst.sort()
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
        TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'
        >>>
        >>> lst = [ 1, None, 2 ]
        >>>
        >>> lst.sort()
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
        TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'NoneType' and 'int'

    The `None` scenario was the one I came across. My SO-inspired solution, a list-comprehension: [code-link](https://github.com/birkin/book_locator_project/blob/2593df456f498ae8eda65e3d5587f7055ec9049e/book_locator_app/lib/index.py#L260-L262)

        >>> cleaned_lst = [ x for x in lst if x ]
        >>> cleaned_lst.sort()

    - Ok, this is cool... at the last minute I figured I'd add a link to info on python [list-comprehensions](https://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Comprehensions.html), for the myriad readers of these dev-notes. The link above has this...

        _"Comprehensions are constructs that allow sequences to be built from other sequences."_

        Ok, fine, nice and concise. But __then__...

        _"Python 2.0 introduced list comprehensions and Python 3.0 comes with dictionary and set comprehensions."_

        What‽

        I don't work with set's much, but _dictionary-comprehensions_ ‽‽‽

        B.C. -- how about a report on those next week!
