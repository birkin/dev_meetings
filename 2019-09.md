2019-September-12 - post-sprint demos
=====================================


### new-Josiah now pointing to new booklocator

- new booklocator put in place last sprint; advantages:
    - more maintainable
    - decoupled from availability-logic & requesting-logic

- updated an api that new-Josiah calls so the api points to the new book-locator code.

- next up: look into updating the scili map floor display.

- example rock results [link](https://search.library.brown.edu/catalog?utf8=âœ“&f%5Bbuilding_facet%5D%5B%5D=Rockefeller&f%5Bformat%5D%5B%5D=Book&search_field=all_fields&q=zen+motorcycle)

### new availability-api in place and being used

- problem (fixed)... Some Annex and Annex-Hay requests were failing because an old availability-api using z39.50 sometimes could not ascertain the required item-id. Failure example:
    - example [Josiah bib-record](https://search.library.brown.edu/catalog/b5479552)
    - old availability service [failed-call](https://library.brown.edu/availability_service/v2/bib/b5479552/) (example of old service [good-call](https://library.brown.edu/availability_service/v2/bib/b2498067/))

- new availability-api...
    - note: This availability-api webapp itself isn't new -- it's been used for a year or two to handle easyBorrow isbn and oclc lookups. What's new is the bib-items lookup.
    - example returned [good-data](https://library.brown.edu/availability_api/v2/bib_items/b5479552/) for above example Josiah bib.
    - uses Sierra APIs instead of somewhat complicated z39.50 calls and parsing.
    - allows the old availability-service to be retired in favor of the more capable and maintainable new service.
    - will likely allow for the too-coupled api that new-Josiah calls to be retired at some point.

- updated the easyRequest and easyRequest-Hay webapps (for Annex an Annex-Hay requesting) to use the new availability-api

### programmatic holds!

- working on the above project, using the Sierra APIs, I experimented with another goal: to replace the existing somewhat brittle ILS requesting code with code that uses the Sierra APIs.

- success making programmatic holds! ([link](https://github.com/birkin/sierra_hold_experimentation_code/blob/53dabd2e36ef567b032bc17b68ffbc4cf854d64e/request_item.py))

- useful for...
    - easyRequest-hay
    - easyRequest
    - possibly remove the last classic-Josiah use of the request-button that new-Josiah doesn't have
    - possibly help automate a very detailed process some 104 folk go through when processing annex end-of-day reports for accessions & refiles.
    - other?

2019-September-06 - dev-meeting
===============================

### regex

- goal: to find two words within x words of each other.

- solution: via googling, ended up using:

        \b(?:word1\W+(?:\w+\W+){0,5}?word2|word2\W+(?:\w+\W+){0,5}?word1)\b

    ...and came across a cool site: <https://regex101.com/r/vH8gX6/407>. Some nice features of that site:

    - it gives you a url for your regex and content

    - it has a cool code-generation page, for different languages, each of which is also [link-able](https://regex101.com/r/vH8gX6/407/codegen?language=python).

### sunsetting...

_(didn't get to this on the 6th)_

Thought exercise...

- what would be good to sunset from the very beginning...
    - P.I.I.

- re above, what would be good structures to use to help enforce this?
    - server where anything a year or more old is auto-deleted
    - work-folder named "DELETE_AFTER_X(date)"

### check-digit...

- gist: <https://gist.github.com/birkin/0bf7c1c3352b0d7416f6b655c0161894>

- usage:

        $ python3 /path/to/sierra_check_digit.py 15990359
        check_digit, `2`
        $

        or to see detailed calcs...

        $ python3 /path/to/sierra_check_digit.py 15990359
        ...build_check_digit()::14] character, `9`
        ...build_check_digit()::16] one_index, `1`
        ...build_check_digit()::18] multiplier, `2`
        ...build_check_digit()::20] multiplied, `18`
        ...build_check_digit()::22] total, `18`
        ...build_check_digit()::14] character, `5`
        ...build_check_digit()::16] one_index, `2`
        ...build_check_digit()::18] multiplier, `3`
        ...build_check_digit()::20] multiplied, `15`
        ...build_check_digit()::22] total, `33`
        [SNIP]
        ...build_check_digit()::22] total, `211`
        ...build_check_digit()::26] check_digit, `2`
        check_digit, `2`
        $

- tidbits...

    I knew about python's modulus function, `211 % 11` (== 2), but I didn't know you could get the integer part of the quotient by `211 // 11` (== 19), or about divmod():

            >>> divmod( 211, 11 )
            (19, 2)
            >>>
