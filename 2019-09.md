2019-September-20 - dev-meeting
===============================


### data-feed

(dev meeting not held, so share this at next dev meeting)

- My thought: while working on a project, ask what might be one or two stats/reports that'd be useful to clients/managers. Because while doing the actual work, it may be trivial to add that feature on, whereas it'd take more work (of getting back into the code and headspace) to implement it later.

- A few examples:
    - [annex end-of-day counts](https://library.brown.edu/annex_counts/stats/?start_date=2019-09-01&end_date=2019-09-30)
    - [annex scan-requests](https://library.brown.edu/easyscan/stats_api/v1/?start_date=2019-09-01&end_date=2019-09-30)
    - [easyborrow dispositions](https://library.brown.edu/easyborrow/stats_api/v2/?start_date=2019-09-01&end_date=2019-09-30)
    - [hay requesting landing-page usage](https://library.brown.edu/easyrequest_hay/stats_api/?start_date=2019-09-01&end_date=2019-09-30)

### old dashboard

(dev meeting not held, so share this at next dev meeting)

- For a meeting, I wanted to show S.B. some work I'd done long ago.

- Dev-server demo of
    - [info page](https://dlibwwwcit.services.brown.edu/dashboard/info/)
    - [widget list](https://dlibwwwcit.services.brown.edu/dashboard/widgets/all/)

- The goal of that...
    - to have a central place that could gather and display data from above-type feeds.
    - given that being in place, to encourage us to develop feeds of data while we're implementing projects.

===============================


### sort according to external list

- simple sorting

        >>> ints = [ 3, 1, 2 ]
        >>> sorted( ints )  # used to store the sorted order to another variable
        [1, 2, 3]
        >>> ints            # original variable not changed
        [3, 1, 2]
        >>> ints.sort()     # no output, because the list is sorted in-place
        >>> ints
        [1, 2, 3]

- object sorting

        >>> lion = { 'name': 'lion', 'color': 'tan' }
        >>> panther = { 'name': 'panther', 'color': 'black' }
        >>> tiger = { 'name': 'tiger', 'color': 'striped' }
        >>> animals = [ tiger, lion, panther ]

        >>> animals
        [{'color': 'striped', 'name': 'tiger'},
         {'color': 'tan', 'name': 'lion'},
         {'color': 'black', 'name': 'panther'}]

        >>> sorted( animals )
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
        <ipython-input-20-5dac7310ae85> in <module>()
        ----> 1 sorted( animals )
        TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'dict' and 'dict'

        >>> animals.sort()
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
        <ipython-input-25-3d34a4aea88a> in <module>()
        ----> 1 animals.sort()
        TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'dict' and 'dict'

        >>> from operator import itemgetter
        >>> sorted( animals, key=itemgetter('color') )  # reminder, `animals` is still [ tiger, lion, panther ]
        [{'color': 'black', 'name': 'panther'},
         {'color': 'striped', 'name': 'tiger'},
         {'color': 'tan', 'name': 'lion'}]

        ## ...or...

        >>> sorted( animals, key = lambda x: x['color'] )  # lambdas are essentially one-line functions with syntax of `argument: expression`
        [{'color': 'black', 'name': 'panther'},
         {'color': 'striped', 'name': 'tiger'},
         {'color': 'tan', 'name': 'lion'}]


    ( great walk-through of lambdas: https://www.afternerd.com/blog/python-lambdas/ )

- ok, but what if I want to sort the animals based on 'size' or 'risk-of-extinction' -- which, say, are found in external lists?
    - a solution from scanning S.O. (didn't keep the citations! Grr...):

            ## the external lists

            >>> size_HtL = [ 'lion', 'tiger', 'panther' ]
            >>> risk_HtL = [ 'tiger', 'panther', 'lion' ]

            ## then, to use the external list for the sort ( reminder, `animals` is `[ tiger, lion, panther ]` )...

            >>> sorted( animals, key=lambda x: size_HtL.index(x['name']) )
            [{'color': 'tan', 'name': 'lion'},
             {'color': 'striped', 'name': 'tiger'},
             {'color': 'black', 'name': 'panther'}]

            >>> sorted( animals, key=lambda x: risk_HtL.index(x['name']) )
            [{'color': 'striped', 'name': 'tiger'},
             {'color': 'black', 'name': 'panther'},
             {'color': 'tan', 'name': 'lion'}]

- Why all this? Because a bib-items Sierra API query returns bib-items, but not in any useful order. That's a problem if I want to display 'callnumber Box 1' before 'callnumber Box 2'. The only way I could find to sort them was according the order of the 945 fields (a separate query). So I make a list of the 945-item-ids, and use that list for the sort-order of the list of bib-item-dict entries.

2019-September-12 - post-sprint demos
=====================================


### new-Josiah now pointing to new booklocator

- new booklocator put in place last sprint; advantages:
    - more maintainable
    - decoupled from availability-logic & requesting-logic

- updated an api that new-Josiah calls so the api points to the new book-locator code.

- next up: look into updating the scili map floor display.

- example rock results [link](https://search.library.brown.edu/catalog?utf8=âœ“&f%5Bbuilding_facet%5D%5B%5D=Rockefeller&f%5Bformat%5D%5B%5D=Book&search_field=all_fields&q=zen+motorcycle)

---


### new availability-api in place and being used

- problem (fixed)... Some Annex and Annex-Hay requests were failing because an old availability-api using z39.50 sometimes could not ascertain the required item-id. Failure example:
    - example [Josiah bib-record](https://search.library.brown.edu/catalog/b5479552)
    - old availability service [failed-call](https://library.brown.edu/availability_service/v2/bib/b5479552/) (example of old service [good-call](https://library.brown.edu/availability_service/v2/bib/b2498067/))

- new availability-api...
    - note: This availability-api webapp itself isn't new -- it's been used for a year or two to handle easyBorrow isbn and oclc lookups. What's new is the bib-items lookup.
    - example returned [good-data](https://library.brown.edu/availability_api/v2/bib_items/b5479552/) for above example Josiah bib.
    - uses Sierra APIs instead of somewhat complicated z39.50 calls and parsing.
    - allows the old availability-service to be retired in favor of the more capable and maintainable new service.
    - will likely allow for the too-coupled api that new-Josiah calls to be retired at some point.

- updated the easyRequest and easyRequest-Hay webapps (for Annex and Annex-Hay requesting) to use the new availability-api.

### programmatic holds!

- working on the above project, using the Sierra APIs, I experimented with another goal: to replace the existing somewhat brittle ILS requesting code with code that uses the Sierra APIs.

- success making programmatic holds! ([link](https://github.com/birkin/sierra_hold_experimentation_code/blob/53dabd2e36ef567b032bc17b68ffbc4cf854d64e/request_item.py))

- useful for...
    - easyRequest-hay
    - easyRequest
    - possibly remove the last classic-Josiah use of the request-button that new-Josiah doesn't have
    - possibly help automate a very detailed process some 104 folk go through when processing annex end-of-day reports for accessions & refiles.
    - other?

2019-September-06 - dev-meeting
===============================

### regex

- goal: to find two words within x words of each other.

- solution: via googling, ended up using:

        \b(?:word1\W+(?:\w+\W+){0,5}?word2|word2\W+(?:\w+\W+){0,5}?word1)\b

    ...and came across a cool site: <https://regex101.com/r/vH8gX6/407>. Some nice features of that site:

    - it gives you a url for your regex and content

    - it has a cool code-generation page, for different languages, each of which is also [link-able](https://regex101.com/r/vH8gX6/407/codegen?language=python).

### sunsetting...

_(didn't get to this on the 6th)_

Thought exercise...

- what would be good to sunset from the very beginning...
    - P.I.I.

- re above, what would be good structures to use to help enforce this?
    - server where anything a year or more old is auto-deleted
    - work-folder named "DELETE_AFTER_X(date)"

### check-digit...

- gist: <https://gist.github.com/birkin/0bf7c1c3352b0d7416f6b655c0161894>

- usage:

        $ python3 /path/to/sierra_check_digit.py 15990359
        check_digit, `2`
        $

        or to see detailed calcs...

        $ python3 /path/to/sierra_check_digit.py 15990359
        ...build_check_digit()::14] character, `9`
        ...build_check_digit()::16] one_index, `1`
        ...build_check_digit()::18] multiplier, `2`
        ...build_check_digit()::20] multiplied, `18`
        ...build_check_digit()::22] total, `18`
        ...build_check_digit()::14] character, `5`
        ...build_check_digit()::16] one_index, `2`
        ...build_check_digit()::18] multiplier, `3`
        ...build_check_digit()::20] multiplied, `15`
        ...build_check_digit()::22] total, `33`
        [SNIP]
        ...build_check_digit()::22] total, `211`
        ...build_check_digit()::26] check_digit, `2`
        check_digit, `2`
        $

- tidbits...

    I knew about python's modulus function, `211 % 11` (== 2), but I didn't know you could get the integer part of the quotient by `211 // 11` (== 19), or about divmod():

            >>> divmod( 211, 11 )
            (19, 2)
            >>>
