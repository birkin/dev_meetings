### regex

- goal: to find two words within x words of each other.

- solution: via googling, ended up using:

        \b(?:word1\W+(?:\w+\W+){0,5}?word2|word2\W+(?:\w+\W+){0,5}?word1)\b

    ...and came across a cool site: <https://regex101.com/r/vH8gX6/407>. Some nice features of that site:

    - it gives you a url for your regex and content-math

    - it has a cool code-generation page, for different languages, each of which is also [link-able](https://regex101.com/r/vH8gX6/407/codegen?language=python).

### sunsetting...

Thought exercise...

- what would be good to sunset from the very beginning...
    - P.I.I.

- re above, what would be good structures to use to help enforce this?
    - server where anything a year or more old is auto-deleted
    - work-folder named "DELETE_AFTER_X(date)"

### check-digit...

- gist: <https://gist.github.com/birkin/0bf7c1c3352b0d7416f6b655c0161894>

- usage:

        $ python3 /path/to/sierra_check_digit.py 15990359
        check_digit, `2`
        $

        or to see detailed calcs...

        $ python3 /path/to/sierra_check_digit.py 15990359
        ...build_check_digit()::14] character, `9`
        ...build_check_digit()::16] one_index, `1`
        ...build_check_digit()::18] multiplier, `2`
        ...build_check_digit()::20] multiplied, `18`
        ...build_check_digit()::22] total, `18`
        ...build_check_digit()::14] character, `5`
        ...build_check_digit()::16] one_index, `2`
        ...build_check_digit()::18] multiplier, `3`
        ...build_check_digit()::20] multiplied, `15`
        ...build_check_digit()::22] total, `33`
        [SNIP]
        ...build_check_digit()::22] total, `211`
        ...build_check_digit()::26] check_digit, `2`
        check_digit, `2`
        $

- tidbits...

    I knew about python's modulus function, `211 % 11` (== 2), but I didn't know you could get the integer part of the quotient by `211 // 11` (== 19), or about divmod():

            >>> divmod( 211, 11 )
            (19, 2)
            >>>
