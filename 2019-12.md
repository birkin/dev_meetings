### I'm not what you think I am

Had a funny head-spinning few moments working on a project recently.

For a project on which I'm using mongo for the first time, I queried all the entries in a collection, which went fine.

I then iterated through them, via a for-loop, to massage some data (appending each massaged-entry to another list) before returning a response. In the early stages of that work, I logged the output and saw that each entry in the result-set list appeared to be a dict. Fine; that made sense.

During a refactor, I figured I'd add a log-statement to compare the _before-massage_ query-result dict-list and _after-massage_ dict-list. But, since I only wanted to glance at a few, I figured I'd just log a slice. For the before-massage log-entry, I went right to the fuction where I queried the data to add the [log-entry](https://github.com/birkin/mp_vl_project/blob/c7d3eb4a8e557ed6128df30126b7169c651fb310/mp_vl_app/lib/mongo_access.py#L39).

...and then elsewhere, in a massage_data() function, I added a similar log-entry on the new massaged-list, the same way.

To trigger the logging, I hit the appropriate url, and, to my surprise, saw that only 10 entries displayed on the page, not the full list of entries!

Turns out a pymongo result-set is _neither_ a list, or a list-like object, but rather is a [pymongo Cursor object](https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/api/pymongo/cursor.html) that appears to be lazily-evaluated -- so that the slice works __directly__ on it, rather than creating a copy of the subset of data -- as would be expected if slicing a list. Live and learn!
