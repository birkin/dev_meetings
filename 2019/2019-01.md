### email-admin-on-error

- Issue...
    - Background... Investigating a solr upgrade for an old project, I realized I wasn't getting admin-error-emails on django application errors, as I normally do. I tracked down the numerous pieces that have to be in place and got that working _(todo: document those here for reference)_. I then checked the current, newer project I was working on to see if I was getting admin-error-emails -- I wasn't. Grrr... Again I put the proper pieces in place. This of course makes me want to add this check to the [good-code](https://library.brown.edu/good_code/) webapp. I _will_ do that, but when I checked the old and newer project -- it was kind of a hassle: I had to go into code, generate an exception, update that error to our dev-server, and trigger it (and then of course remove the error and update the code again).
    - So the issue: how to easily check whether my web-apps are properly configured to send admin-error-emails?

- Solution...
    - Not sure if this is clever, or sadly "adorable" `(@KH)`  :), but my solution: add a [simple error-check url](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/illiad3_webservice/blob/3992893a56688b13290e20c39d4f6f3d444d41d0/illiad_app/views.py#L71-L76) set to actually trigger only on development non-public deployment. Adding this as a standard view-function -- like my now-standard ['info' function](https://library.brown.edu/illiad3_api/info/) that displays branch and commit info at a glance -- makes it easy to perform these checks. Nice!

### unpaywall

- My heroes of December: Heather Piwowar & Jason Priem

- ["How Unpaywall is transforming open science"](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05968-3) -- excerpts...

    - goal...

        _...Research by Priem and Piwowar published in August 2017... ...suggests that almost half of the recent research papers that people search for online are available for free. But, says Priem, “there is a terrific gap between the availability and discoverability” of these papers, and it is this problem Unpaywall hopes to solve..._ [_(reference-1)_](https://www.nature.com/news/half-of-papers-searched-for-online-are-free-to-read-1.22418) [_(reference-2)_](https://peerj.com/preprints/3119/)

    - vendor integration...

        _...In June 2017, Unpaywall was integrated into... ...Web of Science... ...On 26 July, Elsevier announced plans to integrate Unpaywall into its Scopus database searches..._

- [unpaywall "Libraries User Guide"](https://unpaywall.org/user-guides/libraries)

- and there's an API

    - [documentation](https://unpaywall.org/products/api)
        - [data-format documentation](https://unpaywall.org/data-format)

    - [example query and response](https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1038/nature12373?email=birkin_diana@brown.edu)

- possibly making BDR openAccess materials a source? -- <https://unpaywall.org/sources>

### CETEIcean

- used to display information for the IIP project ([main](https://library.brown.edu/cds/projects/iip/viewinscr/abur0001/) / [dev](https://library.brown.edu/iip_development/viewinscr/abur0001/))

- [thorough overview](http://teic.github.io/CETEIcean/Balisage-CETEIcean.html)

    - Excerpts...

        `The standard method for displaying a TEI document on the web is to either pre-transform it to HTML using XSLT or to dynamically transform it to HTML, again usually with XSLT or possibly XQuery.... ...CETEIcean... was developed to support a lightweight TEI presentation workflow that requires neither pre-display document transformation nor any complex server-side architecture. All that is needed to use it is a web server. The browser does all of the work. CETEIcean is an ECMAScript (JavaScript) library that reads in TEI XML and converts it to HTML Custom Elements. The converted source can then be rendered using standard CSS and JavaScript techniques. CETEIcean supplies a method, calld "behaviors" to add decorations—or even make widgets out of—TEI elements...`

        `CETEIcean converts all TEI elements to an “HTML” equivalent with a tei- prefix... ...For most elements, this is sufficient, but for TEI elements which have HTML equivalents, more work is necessary. TEI has a couple of constructs roughly equivalent to HTML <a href> for example, namely <ref target> and <ptr target/>... ...CETEIcean handles this...`

### ILLiad web api

- [documentation link](https://prometheus.atlas-sys.com/display/illiad/The+ILLiad+Web+Platform+API) found by J.M. (yay!):

- highlights... (search the page on these terms; they're not directly link-able)

    - easyAccess functionality
        - "Get user by username"
            - I don't see a way to determine `blocked` status, but will look more
        - "Create User"
        - "Create a transaction request"
        - I don't see a way to _update_ a user, but will look more

    - K.H. cool "[myStuff](https://library.brown.edu/libweb/mystuff/)" functionality
        - "Retrieving Requests for User"

### regular-expression coolness...

- Issue: long ago for the [IIP project](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/iip-texts), some folk were using Microsoft Word's xml-export function. The problem, as described to me, was that there was (is?) some sort of internal size-saving/efficiency mechanism that 'normalized' similar-appearing characters. The problem: many non-ascii characters were turned into their ascii look-alikes. Example -- the [Greek 'R'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho) characters were turned into the Latin 'P'.

- Solution: Elli was able to find and correct these characters by running the errant text through regular expressions, searching unicode ranges. Who knew [regular-expressions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3748855/how-do-i-specify-a-range-of-unicode-characters-in-a-regular-expression-in-python) could do this? (Besides K.H.!!!)
    - unicode technical standard -- [unicode regular expressions](http://unicode.org/reports/tr18/)
