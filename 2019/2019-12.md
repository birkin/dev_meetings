### lru caching

A colleague recently slack-posted a post on [python-tips](https://martinheinz.dev/blog/4), one of which was about python's 'lru_cache' decorator.

Wikipedia has a really nice ["least-recently-used" cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)) brief description (and non-fancy-visualization), and I was smitten with the elegant simplicity of the tracking method. (I'd assumed it would've had to have tracked & compared dates -- much more expensive.)

It so happened I was working on migrating some student-code, and was wondering about the [expense of a function](https://github.com/birkin/mp_vl_project/blob/9bf5b893a244331bbeb7109aa02795a8c82f4385/mp_vl_app/lib/views_api_entries_helper.py#L84-L93) that converts a month-int into a month-string.

I applied the lru_cache decorator to it, and ran timeit on it, and it's nearly 3 times faster.

Here's [the gist](https://gist.github.com/birkin/d9f948b3a209761b1f6b267ad03a1996) of the timeit code.

- I could have timed this more simply, but I  wanted the random-number to be passed in.
- Each result is the time-taken for 100,000 executions -- so the real-world time-saved is very, very small.
- Of the three results, I drop the high and low, then make the comparison (I was worried the randomization might skew things, but didn't need to worry after bumping up the number of executions).

And the output...

    (env3_mpvl) $ python ./time_test.py
    cache_code_raw_rslt, ```[0.14572594900164404, 0.14264875200024107, 0.14319889599937596]```
    non_cache_code_raw_rslt, ```[0.4112262599992391, 0.408067944998038, 0.4060513680014992]```
    cache_rslt, ```0.14319889599937596```
    non_cache_rslt, ```0.408067944998038```
    cache_rslt is `2.849658456862798` times faster

Kudos to my colleagues' embrace of a culture of sharing on slack!

### I'm not what you think I am

Had a funny head-spinning few moments working on a project recently.

For a project on which I'm using mongo for the first time, I queried all the entries in a collection, which went fine.

I then iterated through them, via a for-loop, to massage some data (appending each massaged-entry to another list) before returning a response. In the early stages of that work, I logged the output and saw that each entry in the result-set list appeared to be a dict. Fine; that made sense.

During a refactor, I figured I'd add a log-statement to compare the _before-massage_ query-result dict-list and _after-massage_ dict-list. But, since I only wanted to glance at a few, I figured I'd just log a slice. For the before-massage log-entry, I went right to the fuction where I queried the data to add the [log-entry](https://github.com/birkin/mp_vl_project/blob/c7d3eb4a8e557ed6128df30126b7169c651fb310/mp_vl_app/lib/mongo_access.py#L39).

...and then elsewhere, in a massage_data() function, I added a similar log-entry on the new massaged-list, the same way.

To trigger the logging, I hit the appropriate url, and, to my surprise, saw that only 10 entries displayed on the page, not the full list of entries!

Turns out a pymongo result-set is _neither_ a list, or a list-like object, but rather is a [pymongo Cursor object](https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/api/pymongo/cursor.html) that appears to be lazily-evaluated -- so that the slice works __directly__ on it, rather than creating a copy of the subset of data -- as would be expected if slicing a list. Live and learn!
