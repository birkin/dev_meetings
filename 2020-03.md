### react asides

From investigating [react](https://reactjs.org) -- a javascript framework -- a few interesting asides...

- from a [hello-world tutorial](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html): "...This guide occasionally uses some of the newer JavaScript syntax in the examples. If you haven’t worked with JavaScript in the last few years, [these three points](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/683e676101005de0add59e8bb345340c) should get you most of the way..."

- that [these three points](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/683e676101005de0add59e8bb345340c) link is interesting, and includes "...Also, when you feel unsure about what some newer syntax means, you can use the Babel REPL with the ES2015 preset to check what equivalent older syntax it compiles to..."

- That text contains a link, which fails, but, exploring the failed link site, i made [one that works](https://babeljs.io/repl#?browsers=&build=&builtIns=false&spec=false&loose=false&code_lz=B4AgvAfCoFQgTAbgFBA&debug=false&forceAllTransforms=false&shippedProposals=false&circleciRepo=&evaluate=false&fileSize=false&timeTravel=false&sourceType=module&lineWrap=true&presets=es2015&prettier=true&targets=Node-6.12&version=7.8.7&externalPlugins=) -- and shows part of what [babel](https://babeljs.io/) can do. It's a javascript compiler that can do a lot of things.

    - in that read–eval–print loop (REPL) site, it's showing how it can rewrite javascript, so that a wider variety of browsers (that might only support older versions of javascript) can read it.

    - it can also compile 'JSX' -- used by react -- into javascript. From [reactenlightenment.com](https://www.reactenlightenment.com/react-jsx/5.1.html)...

        _JSX is an XML/HTML-like syntax used by React that extends ECMAScript so that XML/HTML-like text can co-exist with JavaScript/React code. The syntax is intended to be used by preprocessors (i.e., transpilers like Babel) to transform HTML-like text found in JavaScript files into standard JavaScript objects that a JavaScript engine will parse._

        _Basically, by using JSX you can write concise HTML/XML-like structures (e.g., DOM like tree structures) in the same file as you write JavaScript code, then Babel will transform these expressions into actual JavaScript code. Unlike the past, instead of putting JavaScript into HTML, JSX allows us to put HTML into JavaScript..._

    - and i'm sure there's a ton of other stuff it can do.

### bookmarklets

- challenge:

    I want to test annex-hay handling, starting, say, [here](https://search.library.brown.edu/catalog/b1576761).

    But I don't want to go where the request_access link takes me; I want to go to my localdev box running at 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/etc'.

    _AND_, I can't simply replace the resulting request_access link with my localdev prefix, because of a referrer-check ([example fail](https://library.brown.edu/easyrequest_hay/confirm/?item_bib=b1576761&item_barcode=31236083042989&item_title=Jefferson%20and/or%20Mussolini;%20l%27idea%20statale;%20fascism,%20as%20I%20have%20seen%20it&item_author=by%20Ezra%20Pound%20..&item_publisher=London,%20S.%20Nott%20[1935]&item_callnumber=1901%20P876j&item_location=ANNEX%20HAY&item_digital_version_url=&referring_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsearch.library.brown.edu%2Fcatalog%2Fb1576761))

- solution:

    Use a bookmarklet, and, for extra convenience, have it reference an external javascript file (that way it can be shared, and updates made easily).

    All my bookmarklets have this structure:

        javascript:(function(){
            document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='https://library.brown.edu/bjd/2019/ezr-hay_lib-to-local.js';
            })();

    That [js file](https://library.brown.edu/bjd/2019/ezr-hay_lib-to-local.js) simply finds the easyrequest_hay links, and updates them to my project's local-box url.
