### speed-play

Opening and searching through a 5.7GB file... [code here](https://gist.github.com/birkin/e2ec21681627e3c5b65a7faf10889742)

##### python...

    $
    $ time python3 ./bigfile.py
    count, ``110431``
    elapsed_time, ``0:00:43.559190``

    real    0m43.633s
    user    0m42.232s
    sys 0m1.359s
    $

##### regular grep

(there was no speedup with the '-E' flag J.M. suggested)

    $
    $ time grep -c "Message-ID:" ./5p7_gb.txt
    110431

    real    0m51.794s
    user    0m51.017s
    sys 0m0.762s
    $

##### rust...

    $
    $ time ./bigfile
    count, ``110431``
    zduration, ``3.126290809s``

    real    0m3.133s
    user    0m2.156s
    sys 0m0.972s
    $

##### ripgrep

And the winner, at J.M.'s suggestion: [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)!! (followed path to the bin directory and saw that you use 'rg' to call it)

    $
    $ time rg -c "Message-ID:" ./5p7_gb.txt
    110431

    real    0m1.846s
    user    0m1.167s
    sys 0m0.678s
    $

### web-assembly

##### overview...

Excerpts from mozilla -- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly>...

- _...provides a way to run code written in multiple languages on the web at near native speed, with client apps running on the web that previously couldnâ€™t have done so._

- _...designed to complement and run alongside JavaScript... ...and share functionality between the two... ...even if you don't know how to write WebAssembly code._

- _...being developed as a web standard via the W3C WebAssembly Working Group and Community Group with active participation from all major browser vendors._

##### Other resources...

##### My thoughts...

- Not relevant to us currently for _development_ work. It requires compiling/tooling; I think the two main current languages that offer the capability to compile into webassembly are C & Rust; the speedup, as I recall, over well-optimized & minified javascript is generally 30% or less (far less dramatic than C or Rust code vs, say, standard python or ruby).

- _However_ -- there are services we utilize -- or may in the future -- that _could_ benefit from webassembly. Client-side rendering/transformations of maps and images, and js-libraries that parse & transform xml are two examples. I could imagine that over time, some js-packages in this space will offer versions that offload pieces of work to webassembly. And as more applications become cloud-based, vendors may well inject webassembly into pages.
