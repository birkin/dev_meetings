### web-assembly

##### overview...

Excerpts from mozilla -- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly>...

- _...provides a way to run code written in multiple languages on the web at near native speed, with client apps running on the web that previously couldnâ€™t have done so._

- _...designed to complement and run alongside JavaScript... ...and share functionality between the two... ...even if you don't know how to write WebAssembly code._

- _...being developed as a web standard via the W3C WebAssembly Working Group and Community Group with active participation from all major browser vendors._

##### My thoughts...

- Not relevant to us currently for _development_ work. It requires compiling/tooling; I think the two main current languages that offer the capability to compile into webassembly are C & Rust; the speedup, as I recall, over well-optimized & minified javascript is generally 30% or less (far less dramatic than C or Rust code vs, say, standard python or ruby).

- _However_ -- there are services we utilize -- or may in the future -- that _could_ benefit from webassembly. Client-side rendering/transformations of maps and images, and js-libraries that parse & transform xml are two examples. I could imagine that over time, some js-packages in this space will offer versions that offload pieces of work to webassembly. And as more applications become cloud-based, vendors may well inject webassembly into pages.
