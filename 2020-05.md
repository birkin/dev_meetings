### mysql to sqlite3

- issue: Say you want to use updated production mysql data for your localdev sqlite3 db. What's an easy way to get it?

- usage flow

    - export db with [mysqldump](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqldump.html) like...

            $ mysqldump -h HOSTNAME -u USERNAME -p --default-character-set=utf8mb4 DATABASE_NAME > /PATH/TO/THE_FILE.sql

        (I like the arrangement of the sql from `mysqldump` more than the equivalent phpMyAdmin export -- and I think I've heard it's more reliable if the database is big.)

    - create an sqlite3 db from that

        - am looking for something considered reliable

            - github shows [27 repositories](https://github.com/search?q=mysql2sqlite) for "mysql2sqlite" (2020-May-22)

            - quick-tried [one](https://github.com/dumblob/mysql2sqlite) (it has a bunch of github issues):

                    $ git clone https://github.com/dumblob/mysql2sqlite.git ./mysql2sqlite
                    $ ./mysql2mysql2sqlite/mysql2sqlite ./dump_file.sql | sqlite3 ./new_db_that_will_be_created.db

### django testing

- issue, if the django DEBUG setting is set to `True`, it will still default to `False` when running tests. Which was causing me a problem with a test.

- [solution](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/disa_dj_project/blob/b98e7c112718f72562a497736777605ac982b221/disa_app/tests.py#L32-L47), thanks to B.C. & [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13596201), using [override_settings](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/disa_dj_project/blob/b98e7c112718f72562a497736777605ac982b221/disa_app/tests.py#L8)

### mysql8 & json idea

- thought -- to have a temporary slack-channel or something where we explore JSON DATA fields

### speed-play

Opening and searching through a 5.7GB file... [code here](https://gist.github.com/birkin/e2ec21681627e3c5b65a7faf10889742)

##### python...

    $
    $ time python3 ./bigfile.py
    count, ``110431``
    elapsed_time, ``0:00:43.559190``

    real    0m43.633s
    user    0m42.232s
    sys 0m1.359s
    $

##### regular grep

(there was no speedup with the '-E' flag J.M. suggested)

    $
    $ time grep -c "Message-ID:" ./5p7_gb.txt
    110431

    real    0m51.794s
    user    0m51.017s
    sys 0m0.762s
    $

##### rust...

    $
    $ time ./bigfile
    count, ``110431``
    zduration, ``3.126290809s``

    real    0m3.133s
    user    0m2.156s
    sys 0m0.972s
    $

##### ripgrep

And the winner, at J.M.'s suggestion: [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)!! (followed path to the bin directory and saw that you use 'rg' to call it)

    $
    $ time rg -c "Message-ID:" ./5p7_gb.txt
    110431

    real    0m1.846s
    user    0m1.167s
    sys 0m0.678s
    $

### web-assembly

##### overview...

Excerpts from mozilla -- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly>...

- _...provides a way to run code written in multiple languages on the web at near native speed, with client apps running on the web that previously couldnâ€™t have done so._

- _...designed to complement and run alongside JavaScript... ...and share functionality between the two... ...even if you don't know how to write WebAssembly code._

- _...being developed as a web standard via the W3C WebAssembly Working Group and Community Group with active participation from all major browser vendors._

##### My thoughts...

- Not relevant to us currently for _development_ work. It requires compiling/tooling; I think the two main current languages that offer the capability to compile into webassembly are C & Rust; the speedup, as I recall, over well-optimized & minified javascript is generally 30% or less (far less dramatic than C or Rust code vs, say, standard python or ruby).

- _However_ -- there are services we utilize -- or may in the future -- that _could_ benefit from webassembly. Client-side rendering/transformations of maps and images, and js-libraries that parse & transform xml are two examples. I could imagine that over time, some js-packages in this space will offer versions that offload pieces of work to webassembly. And as more applications become cloud-based, vendors may well inject webassembly into pages.
