- usage example
    - [import js](https://github.com/birkin/disa_dj_project/blob/ff3a10444ae2e5d9948dc4fbd702121aa96aaede/disa_app/disa_app_templates/search_results.html#L120)
    - [access dom-id and highlight terms](https://github.com/birkin/disa_dj_project/blob/ff3a10444ae2e5d9948dc4fbd702121aa96aaede/disa_app/disa_app_templates/search_results.html#L281-L293)

#### bookmarklets

(other folk presented; I'll share another time)

- challenge:

    I want to test annex-hay handling, starting, say, [here](https://search.library.brown.edu/catalog/b1576761).

    But I don't want to go where the request_access link takes me; I want to go to my localdev box running at 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/etc'.

    _AND_, I can't simply replace the resulting request_access link with my localdev prefix, because of a referrer-check ([example fail](https://library.brown.edu/easyrequest_hay/confirm/?item_bib=b1576761&item_barcode=31236083042989&item_title=Jefferson%20and/or%20Mussolini;%20l%27idea%20statale;%20fascism,%20as%20I%20have%20seen%20it&item_author=by%20Ezra%20Pound%20..&item_publisher=London,%20S.%20Nott%20[1935]&item_callnumber=1901%20P876j&item_location=ANNEX%20HAY&item_digital_version_url=&referring_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsearch.library.brown.edu%2Fcatalog%2Fb1576761))

- solution:

    Use a bookmarklet, and, for extra convenience, have it reference an external javascript file (that way it can be shared, and updates made easily).

    All my bookmarklets have this structure:

        javascript:(function(){
            document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='https://library.brown.edu/bjd/2019/ezr-hay_lib-to-local.js';
            })();

    That [js file](https://library.brown.edu/bjd/2019/ezr-hay_lib-to-local.js) simply finds the easyrequest_hay links, and updates them to my project's local-box url.
