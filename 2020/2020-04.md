### search iteration

I recently had a need to find multiple matches for a text-string in a block of text. Googling & Stack Overflow led me to the [re module's](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) `re.finditer()`

Example usage...

        >>>
        >>> import re
        >>>
        >>> text = 'abbaaabbbbaaaaa'
        >>>
        >>> pattern = 'ab'
        >>>
        >>> for match in re.finditer( pattern, text ):
        ...     s = match.start()
        ...     e = match.end()
        ...     print( f'Found ``{text[s:e]}`` at ``{s}:{e}``' )
        ...
        Found ``ab`` at ``0:2``
        Found ``ab`` at ``5:7``
        >>>


So, since I wanted to grab extra characters, I subtracted 40 characters from my slice-start, and added 40 characters to my slice-end.
