2021-Februar-05 - dev-meeting
=============================

### single-binary web-application?

- <https://github.com/pyros2097/rust-embed>

- example:

    - show resources: <https://github.com/pyros2097/rust-embed/tree/master/examples>

    - run this: `cargo run --example actix --features actix`

    - show a change and re-run

    - & testing: `ab -n 10000 -c 5 http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

- but why? Intriguing, but the interesting possibilities for cross-platform delivery don't seem to outweigh the downsides of losing easy access to the underlying data. But I'm open.
