### handling associated values in solr?

_Real question..._

---


### meet me -- a technological and philosophical exploration

_For discussion..._

- [the start](https://lists.clir.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind2101&L=CODE4LIB&P=34403), which contains in the signature: "Let's talk, just book me here..." ...the idea of which I find fascinating. And the underlying tech...

- "https://calendar.x.ai", which redirects to [https://x.ai/how-it-works/](https://x.ai/how-it-works/)

- Possible uses... for individuals? for 'teams'?

    - One cool use would be for folk who volunteer to be "on call" in CDS. If you could make yourself available for controlled blocks, that'd be cool -- though really you'd want your "friends" _not_ to use those time-frames for that purpose. Hmm.

### sound sound all-around

_just cool_

- Am working on ferrissing P.R. [Ambisonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambisonics) to share his work/thoughts on this.   :)

2021-Februar-05 - dev-meeting
=============================

### single-binary web-application?

- <https://github.com/pyros2097/rust-embed>

- example:

    - show resources: <https://github.com/pyros2097/rust-embed/tree/master/examples>

    - run this: `cargo run --example actix --features actix`

    - show a change and re-run

    - & testing: `ab -n 10000 -c 5 http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

- but why? Intriguing, but the interesting possibilities for cross-platform delivery don't seem to outweigh the downsides of losing easy access to the underlying data. But I'm open.
