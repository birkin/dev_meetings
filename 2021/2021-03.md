### crypto-art

Shared a David Strom post on "[Understanding the issues behind crypto art works](https://blog.strom.com/wp/?p=8463)", which contains some fascinating links, such as this [guide to eco-friendly CryptoArt](https://github.com/memo/eco-nft). That guide has a really useful glossary -- applicable to crypto-currency/blockchain concepts beyond the crypto-art world. Together with the original post, it's given me one of the best skimmed-surface overviews I've seen of how crypto-currencies are being used with block-chain technologies in the real-world.

### ssh tunelling (to solr, for example)

Shared  ssh and ~/.shh/config techniques to access solr, for example, if it's running on port 8084 of somehost.foo.edu

- ssh command example:

        ssh -N -L 9999:somehost.foo.edu:8084 myusername@somehost.foo.edu

    - Parts explanation...
        - The ssh part is the normal secure-shell command.
        - The -N flag specifies that commands flowing over this connection won't be executed on the remote computer, just forwarded.
        - The -L flag specifies the details of the 'localPort:remoteHost:remotePort' section that follows this flag. It means that the local computer should listen for incoming connections on the specified localPort, and forward them over the ssh connection to the remote computer at the remotePort.
        - The 'myusername@somehost.foo.edu' sets up the ssh connection. This prompts you to enter your account-password on the remote computer 'somehost'.
    - Typing that ssh command will create the tunnel, which will be up until Control-C-ing out of the command.

- config example:

    - add this to your `~/.ssh/config` file...

            # ----------------------------
            Host simple-memorable-name
                    HostName somehost.foo.edu
                    User myusername
                    LocalForward localhost:9999 somehost.foo.edu:8084
            # (then <http://127.0.0.1:9999/solr/#/> gets you to the admin)
            # ----------------------------

    - then in your Terminal, type `ssh simple-memorable-name`. Your prompt will return, and the tunnel will exist, and remain up until closing that Terminal tab or window.

### DT Dashboard/Report brainstorming

- genesis: [Alma report list](https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Alma/Product_Documentation/010Alma_Online_Help_(English)/080Analytics/060Out-of-the-Box-Reports)

- Prompts:
    - More inward focus: If you were running DT, what dashboard-widgets or reports would you like to be able to see at a glance to give you an overall sense of the operations?
    - More outward facing: If you were running DT, what dashboard-widgets reports would you like to have at your disposal for other administrative colleagues, and/or the public, to see about DT operations?

### displaying UUIDs -- first experimentation

- [wikipedia UUID entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)

- why UUIDs? And pros & cons...
    - a pro article: <https://devforth.io/blog/why-your-software-should-use-uuids>
    - a [pro/con article](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-uuid/) noting that mysql-8 offers functions for auto-generating UUIDs.
