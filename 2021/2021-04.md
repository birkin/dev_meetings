### reshare & context

Just heard about ReShare.

- <https://projectreshare.org>
- <https://www.indexdata.com/reshare/>

...and though I don't know much about it I'm already a fan because IndexData is _such_ a cool company, and has been forever.

From the project-reshare link, above, it aims to create "...a new and open approach to library resource sharing systems..." "...that supports discovery, fulfillment, and delivery workflows, with a focus on user-centered design..." and prominently feature, in it's evolution, an "...inclusive, community-owned ecosystem made up of libraries, consortia, software developers, and open source advocates..."

Awesome. But even better, though that sounds like a visioning-speak, my understanding is that it's real software, in use. (Correct me if I'm wrong!)

Context...

For some significant Library-related services, the number of for-profit vendors has significantly shrunk over the years. So I've been encouraged that robust consortial software has emerged and continues to evolve. Just a few examples...

- [Blacklight](https://projectblacklight.org), [VUFind](https://vufind.org/vufind/), [Fedora](https://duraspace.org/fedora/), [FOLIO](https://www.folio.org), [POD](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KJ8r2r-ZMVfWNSWcLjtSHzkhO0hGGXvX2RjJL3YIwPg/edit#slide=id.p) _(featuring Anthony & Hector!_  :slightly_smiling_face:  ...

... and ReShare appears to be yet another example.
